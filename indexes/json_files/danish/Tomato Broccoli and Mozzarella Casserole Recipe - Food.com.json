Advertisement      Tweaks   MOST POPULARMOST RECENT                    I suffer from reflux so I made some changes. I reduced the onions to 9 oz. (all I had on hand) and tomatoes to 2. I also added a can of drained artichoke hearts to add more flavor that I might have lost from reducing the onions and tomatoes. I reduced the mozzarella to about 6 oz., again to help my digestion, and left out one of the egg yolks. It was still fantastic!
