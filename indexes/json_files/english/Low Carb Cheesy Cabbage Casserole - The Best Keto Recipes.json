The perfect easy keto dinner!\u00a0\n\n\nThis is one of my favorite easy low carb dinner options. From start to finish it will be in on the table in 30 minutes and only required one pan, talk about easy! I think cabbage is an underused ingredient. I have always loved cabbage rolls. And my all time favorite\u00a0cabbage soup\u00a0because they are hardy, inexpensive meals that go a long way.\nThis One Pan Cabbage Casserole is a low carb version of the classic. Browned meat, chopped cabbage, tomatoes and spices come together to create a healthy, easy comfort food!\u00a0\n\n\nWhat is Cabbage Casserole?\nThis is basically a low carb spin on cabbage rolls. Generally cabbage rolls are pretty tedious. You separate cabbage leaves, then make a stuffing and then roll them into the cabbage leaves kind of like you would enchiladas. It is just an involved process.\nThis recipe has those same great flavors but utilizes chopped cabbage and it is all made in one pan which saves a ton of time. Also, this recipe leaves out the rice making it a great hearty low carb comfort food.\u00a0\nWhat ingredients do you need for low carb Cabbage Casserole?\u00a0\nThis hearty low carb casserole may look like it has a lot of ingredients but really it just has a handful of basic ingredients, most of which are probably pantry staples. These ingredients include:\n\nGround beef or ground turkey\nOnion\nCabbage\n1 can tomatoes with green chilies\n1 can of tomato sauce\nSpices: chili powder,\u00a0garlic powder,\u00a0salt and pepper\nShredded cheese\u00a0\n\nYou may have heard that things like tomatoes and onions are not allowed on a keto diet. However, I do not subscribe to the idea that certain things are \u201cnot allowed\u201d as long as you enjoy them in moderation and can make them fit within your overall carb goals.\u00a0\nThe onion, tomatoes and tomato sauce do add carbs, however the net carb count is still only 7.4 per serving. This will still fall well within a range that I would consider appropriate for a low carb, keto meal.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat are some other easy keto recipes?\nYou will love how easy this one pan meal is. It also reheats perfectly. If you are looking for more low carb one pan recipes try some of these:\n\nKeto Cheesy Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o Chicken. It is packed with smokey, cheesy flavor and comes in around 4 net carbs per serving.\u00a0\nKeto Steak Rolls, your meat and side dish rolled up into one low carb meal!\nKeto Sausage and Cabbage Skillet, this is the definition of easy! Smoked sausage and fried cabbage make for the ultimate low carb comfort food!\nSlow Cooker Ranch Chicken, perfect for busy nights! We have had these on \u201ccheese shells\u201d as tacos, in sweet peppers and just by itself with a salad and parmesan on top!\n\nThis recipe calls for about half a head of cabbage, the other half can be used in this Keto Sausage and Cabbage Skillet\u00a0or this Foil Pack Sausage Cabbage.\u00a0\nYou can also chop the cabbage you aren\u2019t going to use and freeze in a large freezer bag. The next time you want to make this recipe just pull it out a few minutes before cooking. This makes your groceries go a little further! I am all about easy, no waste cooking!\nOther Easy Keto Recipes\nIf you are new to Keto try my favorite Sausage Egg and Cheese Bites, they contain less than one net carb per bite and they are perfect for meal prep! One of my favorite easy low carb dinners is this One Pan Cabbage Casserole.\u00a0It is so easy, cheesy and delicious and it has less than 9 net carbs per serving. Some other favorites, Keto Chocolate Cookies, Pimento Cheese and Bacon Stuffed Peppers and Sausage and Cream Cheese Pinwheels!\u00a0\n \n\n Continue to Content \n \n\n\n\nLow Carb Cheesy Cabbage Casserole\n\n\nYield: \n6\n\n\nPrep Time: \n10 minutes \n\n\nCook Time: \n18 minutes \n\n\nTotal Time: \n28 minutes \n\n\n\nThis Keto One Pan Cabbage Casserole is a low carb, easy dinner ready in 30 minutes!
