The perfect easy keto dinner!\u00a0   This is one of my favorite easy low carb dinner options. From start to finish it will be in on the table in 30 minutes and only required one pan, talk about easy! I think cabbage is an underused ingredient. I have always loved cabbage rolls. And my all time favorite\u00a0cabbage soup\u00a0because they are hardy, inexpensive meals that go a long way. This One Pan Cabbage Casserole is a low carb version of the classic. Browned meat, chopped cabbage, tomatoes and spices come together to create a healthy, easy comfort food!\u00a0   What is Cabbage Casserole? This is basically a low carb spin on cabbage rolls. Generally cabbage rolls are pretty tedious. You separate cabbage leaves, then make a stuffing and then roll them into the cabbage leaves kind of like you would enchiladas. It is just an involved process. This recipe has those same great flavors but utilizes chopped cabbage and it is all made in one pan which saves a ton of time. Also, this recipe leaves out the rice making it a great hearty low carb comfort food.\u00a0 What ingredients do you need for low carb Cabbage Casserole?\u00a0 This hearty low carb casserole may look like it has a lot of ingredients but really it just has a handful of basic ingredients, most of which are probably pantry staples. These ingredients include:  Ground beef or ground turkey Onion Cabbage 1 can tomatoes with green chilies 1 can of tomato sauce Spices: chili powder,\u00a0garlic powder,\u00a0salt and pepper Shredded cheese\u00a0  You may have heard that things like tomatoes and onions are not allowed on a keto diet. However, I do not subscribe to the idea that certain things are \u201cnot allowed\u201d as long as you enjoy them in moderation and can make them fit within your overall carb goals.\u00a0 The onion, tomatoes and tomato sauce do add carbs, however the net carb count is still only 7.4 per serving. This will still fall well within a range that I would consider appropriate for a low carb, keto meal.\u00a0   What are some other easy keto recipes? You will love how easy this one pan meal is. It also reheats perfectly. If you are looking for more low carb one pan recipes try some of these:  Keto Cheesy Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o Chicken. It is packed with smokey, cheesy flavor and comes in around 4 net carbs per serving.\u00a0 Keto Steak Rolls, your meat and side dish rolled up into one low carb meal! Keto Sausage and Cabbage Skillet, this is the definition of easy! Smoked sausage and fried cabbage make for the ultimate low carb comfort food! Slow Cooker Ranch Chicken, perfect for busy nights! We have had these on \u201ccheese shells\u201d as tacos, in sweet peppers and just by itself with a salad and parmesan on top!  This recipe calls for about half a head of cabbage, the other half can be used in this Keto Sausage and Cabbage Skillet\u00a0or this Foil Pack Sausage Cabbage.\u00a0 You can also chop the cabbage you aren\u2019t going to use and freeze in a large freezer bag. The next time you want to make this recipe just pull it out a few minutes before cooking. This makes your groceries go a little further! I am all about easy, no waste cooking!
