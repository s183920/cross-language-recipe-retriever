I tweaked the sauce a bit to make it work with pork chops. Garlicky goodness. These pork chops are just so good and really simple to make. Yes, there\u2019s a whole head of garlic in here as well as garlic powder. The garlic cloves mellow out. You can eat them and they\u2019re not overly garlicky\u2026 they taste kinda like roasted garlic. I like building layers of garlic flavor! It\u2019s the perfect weeknight meal.   What you\u2019ll need  Pork chops \u2013 I use 0.75-1\u2033 boneless pork chops seasoned generously with salt & pepper to bring out the flavor Olive oil and butter \u2013 for pan frying and the base of the sauce Garlic and garlic powder \u2013 there\u2019s absolutely a whole head of garlic in here and garlic powder Flour \u2013 to thicken the sauce Chicken broth \u2013 more savory depth of flavor Lemon juice \u2013 a pop of acidity to balance everything Heavy cream \u2013 to make the sauce luxurious      Helpful tips  Pork chops can easily dry out (especially boneless ones), so I highly recommend getting an instant read meat thermometer so you can check the temperature and not overcook them. Pork is safe to eat at 145F (and don\u2019t forget the temperature continues to climb for a few minutes after you finish cooking it). It\u2019s ok if pork is a bit pink in the middle. You can use either boneless or bone-in pork chops. For larger bone-in chops, you may need to sear them in two batches. If your skillet goes dry, I\u2019d add up to 1 tablespoon extra olive oil for the second batch. I recommend taking the pork chops out of the fridge at least 15-30 minutes prior to starting the recipe. They will cook better this way!     How to make creamy garlic pork chops This is an overview with step-by-step photos. Full ingredients & instructions are in the recipe card below.  Season the pork with salt & pepper. Heat up the oil and some of the butter in a skillet, then sear the chops on both sides until golden. Transfer to a plate. Add the remaining butter and the garlic cloves, and cook until the garlic is lightly browned.  Push the garlic to one side of the skillet, then stir in the flour to make a roux. Pour in the broth and lemon juice, and cook until thickened. Add the cream and garlic powder, and stir until it\u2019s dissolved in.  Return the pork to the skillet, and cook through until the sauce reduces more and the pork is cooked to 145F. Season with extra salt & pepper if needed, and top with fresh parsley if using.   Substitutions and variations  I don\u2019t recommend subbing the cream for a lower fat alternative as it may curdle and the sauce won\u2019t be as thick. You could throw in a handful of spinach at the end before adding the pork back to the pan if you want some greens. Looking to make this with chicken? Try my Creamy Garlic Chicken instead.      What to serve with creamy pork chops  They\u2019re delicious with Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Potatoes, rice, or even pasta like my Quick Garlic Butter Noodles.

Leftovers and storage  Store any leftover pork chops in the fridge in a covered container for 3-4 days. Reheat over a low heat slowly until warmed through so the chops don\u2019t dry out. I don\u2019t recommend freezing this one.

Season the pork generously with salt & pepper on both sides.In a deep skillet, add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium-high heat. Let the pan heat up for a few minutes, and once it's hot, cook the pork chops for 3-5 minutes/side or until golden (3 minutes for thinner chops and 5 minutes for pork chops up to 1\" thick). Once the pork chops are done searing, transfer them to a plate.Add the remaining butter and the garlic cloves to the skillet. Turn the heat down to medium (or medium-low if using cast iron). Cook it, stirring fairly often, for about 3 minutes or until the garlic has somewhat browned on the outside. Push the garlic to one side of the pan and sprinkle the flour in (avoiding the garlic). Let it cook for around 30 seconds, and give it a stir so it's incorporated with the butter (we're making a quick roux).Add in the chicken broth and lemon juice. Stir and let it cook for about a minute or until the sauce is noticeably thickened. Add in the garlic powder and cream. Stir or whisk it until the garlic powder has dissolved. Add the pork back in and cook for another 3-5 minutes or until the sauce has thickened up a bit (let the sauce bubble a bit but not furiously boil) and the pork chops are fully cooked through (145F minimum). Keep in mind the pork's temperature will continue to rise once you stop cooking it, so if it's close, I'd take it off the heat and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. Season the sauce with extra salt & pepper as needed and parsley if you wish. Notes It\u2019s very easy to overcook pork and turn it into shoe leather. I highly recommend using an instant read thermometer to take the guesswork out. Pork that\u2019s 145F and pink inside is safe to eat. You can use boneless pork chops like I did or bone-in. I recommend pork chops that are 0.75-1\u2033 thick. Anything much thicker or thinner is likely to end up under or overcooked with this particular recipe since it\u2019s finished in the cream sauce.
