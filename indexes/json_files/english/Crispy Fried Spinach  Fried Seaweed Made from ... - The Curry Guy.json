It\u2019s long been known that most Chinese \u2018crispy fried seaweed\u2019 isn\u2019t actually seaweed and this crispy fried spinach tastes like the real deal.\nCrispy fried spinach.\nI only got the idea to experiment with this after a visit to Thali on Old Brompton Road in London. They prepared a palak (spinach) chaat from my wife Caroline and me which was absolutely amazing.\nUnfortunately, they didn\u2019t want to give up their recipe so I decided to figure it out for myself.\nI took loads of photos so I could give it a go when I got home. My palak chaat recipe is right here. I think I nailed it!\nThis crispy fried spinach is just one of the ingredients in that chaat but I decided to post it separately as it makes a delicious side dish on its own. It\u2019s so addictive.\n\u00a0\nWorking ahead\u2026\nThis one couldn\u2019t be easier.\nAll you need is fresh spinach, vegetable oil and perhaps a bit of salt or chaat masala.\u00a0I used salt this time like it Chinese restaurants but if you would like to give it an Indian touch, use chaat masala.\nMy recipe for chaat masala is here.\nIf you\u2019re planning a dinner party, this crispy fried spinach can be made a few hours ahead of time as it can be served hot or at room temperature.\nYou will also need some paper kitchen towels to soak up the excess oil. I made it a few days ahead of serving once and it was still very good.\nStoring your crispy fried spinach.\nI keep mine in air-tight jars if keeping longer than a day or so.\nIt keeps crispy and nice. That usually doesn\u2019t happen though. Try some and you\u2019ll see why. I just can\u2019t stop snacking on the stuff.\n\u2013\nWash and dry your spinach.\nStack a few leaves and remove any big stems.\nShred the spinach leaves with a sharp knife.\nFry the spinach in batches until crispy.\nPlace cooked spinach on paper towels to soak up excess oil.\n \n\n Continue to Content \n \n\n\n\nYield: 2 - 4\nHow To Make Crispy Fried Spinach\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\tPrint\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nPrep Time\n10 minutes \n\n\nCook Time\n5 minutes \n\n\nTotal Time\n15 minutes \n\n\n \nIngredients\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t250g fresh spinach - As much as you like\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVegetable oil for deep frying\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSalt to taste\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nWash and dry your spinach leaves.Remove and stems and shred with a sharp knife. You can see how I did this in the photos above.Heat your oil in a large pan. When a piece of spinach instantly sizzles when added to the oil, you're good to go.Depending on how much you are making, you may need to cook the shredded spinach in batches.As the spinach cooks, it will turn a couple of shades darker. That is a pretty good indication that it is ready. Drain cooked crispy spinach on paper towels. It should crisp right up once out of the oil.  Season with a little salt. \n\nRecommended Products\nAs an Amazon Associate and member of other affiliate programs, I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMixing Bowl Set\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLe Creuset Wok\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoseph Joseph cutting board\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZanussi heavy-duty pan\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDeep Fat Fryer\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI.O.Shen Chefs Knife\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDid you like this recipe?\nPlease join me on Facebook where I share all my latest recipes and videos.

Is it because of the water in the spinach?\n\n\n\n\nCaroline Toombs\nMonday 20th of June 2022\n\n\n\nYes that is the reason. Definitely make sure you dry the spinach well after washing it and that should reduce the splashing.\nThanks\nDan\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlease Follow Me!\n\n\n \n\n\nInstagram\n\n \n\n\nFacebook\n\n \n\n\nTwitter\n\n \n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nABOUT ME\n\n\n\nHello and welcome to The Curry Guy food blog.
