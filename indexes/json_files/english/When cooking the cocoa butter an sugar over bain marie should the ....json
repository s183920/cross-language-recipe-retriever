I have made this recipe hundreds of times and it never fails to amaze me.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndarksideofthespoon\n\n          February 28, 2013\n        \nI made them yesterday and I noticed the same thing. I converted my measurements to grams and for a minute, thought I made a mistake. I was even tempted to add a third egg but restrained myself.
