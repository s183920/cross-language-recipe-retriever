Comfort food at its finest! Steak in a creamy white wine sauce, served over pasta OR noodles. Your family will go crazy thinking there\u2019s a hidden chef in your kitchen with this\u00a0Creamy Beef and Mushroom Stroganoff!  No canned soups or ready made packets of anything, and no coating the beef\u00a0with any flour. Just a beautiful, silky cream sauce with a hint of wine aromas gently simmering away on the stove.\u00a0Rivals any restaurant!\u00a0I first shared this recipe three years ago (CD is getting OLD), and readers LOVED it so much back then that I thought I\u2019d fix up the old phots and republish it back with some tips so all of my new readers can make it for dinner! The Best Cut Of Meat For Beef And Mushroom Stroganoff I prefer the following beef cuts in this recipe. They stay tender during the cooking process without drying out and causing overly chewy pieces of meat in your sauce.  Sirloin Tenderloin Eye fillet Scotch fillet Flank steak  Because there is nothing worse than chewy dried out meat!  What Is Stroganoff Sauce Made Of? This version is lightened up with a light or reduced fat sour cream and extra broth (or stock) for MORE SAUCE! There are so many different variations of Beef Stroganoff: some with or without sour cream, and some using brandy instead of wine. During testing, my family, friends and everyone who tried it absolutely loved this version the most.\u00a0I also include Dijon mustard in this one. There\u2019s something about Dijon together with wine in a creamy sauce that warms my soul. Plus paprika and a good hint of garlic, this sauce is pretty much perfection. \u00a0 What Is Beef Stroganoff Served With?  Egg noodles (the most popular side) Pasta (any type: egg fettuccine or angel hair are the most preferred) Plain rice Spaghetti squash (a low calorie option) Zoodles (zucchini noodles)   *ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED MAY 12, 2015* How To Make\u00a0Creamy Beef and Mushroom Stroganoff!

Remove; strain and set aside.While pasta is boiling, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Sear the steak in single layer batches until browned; transfer to a separate plate and set aside until all batches are done.\u00a0Melt the remaining butter in the pan; add the onions and saut\u00e9 until transparent, then add the garlic and fry until just fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are tender and cooked through (about 4 minutes). Mix in the mustard and paprika.Add the wine and cook for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally to mix all of the flavours through, deglazing the pan while scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pan with your spoon. Allow wine to reduce down to about half the amount (about 3 minutes).\u00a0While wine is reducing down, grab a small jug and whisk together the beef broth (or stock), flour and Worcestershire sauce until smooth. Pour the beef broth mixture into the pan, mix well and bring to a simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until the sauce begins to thicken.Return the beef and any juices from the plate to the pan and season with any extra salt and pepper (if desired). Reduce heat down to low and mix in sour cream. Heat until hot (do not boil).Add the pasta or noodles into the pan and garnish with parsley.

Reply       Rob says  April 30, 2020 at 10:49 pm    Hello, nice recipe but weights dont seem to change if selecting different portion size.. apparent for all sizes from 1 to 6 I need 700 grammes of beef. also a little annoying having some measures first in imperial then others in metric first. Figured it out \u2013 very tasy!  Reply       Kerry Santoro says  April 01, 2020 at 10:44 am    Really good as is and really easy \u2013 used a Pinot Grigio and put in a splash extra \u2013 yummy!

Reply       deborah says  February 22, 2020 at 6:06 am   Hi, I have a lot of fresh spinach to use up if I throw it in here do you think it would be good and if so when would I put it in? Thank you!  Reply       Jeannie Gregory says  May 24, 2020 at 1:16 pm   Sure thing \u2013 wash, cut out the ribs, shred the leaves into fine strips and throw them in five minutes before finished. Great flavour, extra fibre, vitamin C and iron.  Reply       Kathy says  November 04, 2020 at 9:18 am    Excellent recipe! I used cream & half & half instead of the sour cream. Also used stew meat that I marinated for a couple hours before saut\u00e9ing. It came out delicious!  Reply           Emily Bowman says  January 23, 2020 at 5:42 pm   Loved it! I made it with ground turkey and it was so good! I like the milkiness of the sauce, extra-thick ones are tasty, but that richness makes you feel so blah later.  Reply       AnotherMother says  January 14, 2020 at 7:09 am    I made it last night and it was a hit.  We can\u2019t wait for leftovers for tonight. Perfect. I used sirloin sliced thin and baby Bella mushrooms. Thank you!  Reply       Debra Bour says  January 11, 2020 at 3:22 am   Absolutely divine! We will only use this recipe now. Husband loves it.  Reply       Jessica says  January 25, 2020 at 10:54 am    This was SO delicious and a great way to use up leftover steak!! I scaled down to about 3.5 of all ingredients (except pasta (egg noodles), which I used about half). So, soo good. Thank you!!

It turned out PERFECT and the flavour is exactly right. Thank you so much, I will be making again for sure!

Thanks  Reply       Ramona LaMont says  June 11, 2019 at 10:21 am    Great recipe\u2014I use my sliced-up leftover grilled (T-Bone) steak added at the end just to heat up for a few minutes and serve over those egg noodles\u2013this way that meat is always sooooo tender!  Reply       Steve Stovall says  May 25, 2019 at 12:35 pm    Made this tonight and used ground turkey instead of the beef. Wife insisted I keep this recipe! Thanks!  Reply       Jessica says  April 27, 2019 at 8:14 pm    We loved this recipe.  We only used half the pasta recommended (and twice the wine ;)) and it was amazing!!!  PS absolutely love your site!!  Reply       Kathy Ryan says  April 11, 2019 at 12:04 pm    Hubs loved it on egg noodles, and I loved it on spaghetti squash! Such a sophisticated-tasting blend of flavors. Will make again!  Reply       Karina says  April 19, 2019 at 1:34 pm   Thank you!  Reply         Heidi Teegarden says  February 28, 2019 at 1:57 pm    My  favorite recipe web site. Often I use cookbooks because I think if someone is going to pay for a book to be published the recipe are tested and must be good. Karina all your stuff I have made is very tasty. I get tons of compliments. I actually chose to make this recipe  instead of going out for dinner.  My husband said is was amazing ,his favorite. I am excited about cooking again now that I have discovered Cafe Delites!!  Reply       Jennifer says  December 27, 2018 at 12:28 pm   does it need to be a dry white wine, or will just about any white wine work?  Reply       Casidy says  November 14, 2018 at 1:16 pm   Made this tonight! Loved the flavor and super simple recipe to follow. Already keep most of these ingredients on hand, so it will be easy to remake anytime!  Reply       Allison says  November 13, 2018 at 11:41 am   We loved this dish and it was easy to make!  Reply       Stephanie Magoon says  November 08, 2018 at 3:22 am    We made this last night with egg noodles and it was delicious; the directions were so easy to follow and tonight we are having the remaining sauce/beef over biscuits. love your recipes on this site.  Reply       Sharon says  November 05, 2018 at 2:51 pm   When do you add the sour cream? I don\u2019t see that under your instructions.  Reply       Karina says  November 07, 2018 at 6:48 pm   You will add in the sour cream at the end in step 6. Hope that helps! XO  Reply         Colleen says  September 02, 2018 at 11:19 am   I used 3 teaspoons of red wine vinegar because I didn\u2019t have any white wine. It was a little runny at the end after I had added the sour cream so I added some cornstarch and it thick and right up. Very tasty and we\u2019ll make again!  Reply       Shirley says  June 14, 2018 at 6:27 am   Nothing is awesome if you have searched for the recipe and can\u2019t find it. I can find pictures. But no recipe. Very disappointing  Reply       Karina says  June 14, 2018 at 7:51 am   Hi! I\u2019m so sorry about this. It seems to be a technical issue on mobile only and we are working on it right now. The recipes are on desktop if you need them urgently! Hopefully we will have all recipes up again soon! Thank you for your patience! Karina X  Reply         Chris says  April 05, 2018 at 11:35 am    Absolutely loved the sauce. Delicious and complex. This is my new favorite beef stragonoff recipe and I have tried several! My only problem was the beef turned out tough and chewy. I am a beginning cook but it seems the beef could be braised in the sauce for 30-40 minutes which would make it very tender? Am I missing something? I might try this next go around and hold off on the mushrooms until near the end.  Reply       Karina says  April 06, 2018 at 2:28 pm   I think you did everything right. I do like to use a meat thermometer to help with the cooking of meat. Once it reaches temperature I will take the meat off the heat or cook it according to the recipe. Hope that helps!  Reply       Janet says  February 26, 2019 at 12:42 am    Some of the recommended cuts can be pretty chewy\u2013the eye of round being one of the toughest on the cow. Sirloins and flank steak are my personal faves for flavor, but I would slice them thin instead of cutting into cubes and cook very lightly, as the recipe states\u2013beef cooked to medium or medium rare is always less chewy than well done. You can also use tenderized cube steaks to get a less tough product. I used a couple of NY strips which I purchased on fantastic sale, sliced thin, similar as for a stir fry\u2013and they were so tender that I could have cubed them. I cooked to medium rare, and they progressed a tad past medium, probably medium well, when added back to the sauce for reheating. The stroganoff was spectacularly good, and I followed the recipe precisely\u2013a rare thing for me. Someone else complained about the sauce being too runny\u2013sour cream can thin or curdle if over heated, so it needs to be added at the very end, again as the recipe states. Another reason for a thin sauce could be that the pasta wasn\u2019t sufficiently drained. The recipe calls for 2 1/3 c of liquid to 2 T of flour which will produce a fairly light sauce, and one that I found perfect, but that could be altered to 3 T of flour for a slightly thicker sauce.  Reply       Jennifer says  September 07, 2019 at 10:53 am    So GOOD! I made this with flank steak so I sliced it across the grain and cooked it just rare. It cooked a little more in the sauce but it was still tender and medium well at that point. The sauce was perfect! Thanks!  Reply         Jade says  January 30, 2018 at 8:22 am    Made this tonight and it\u2019s absolutely gorgeous.  Reply       Gina Kramer says  January 22, 2018 at 7:51 am    Hi Karina, I tried your recipe this evening and it\u2019s really good. Other Stroganoff recipes often turn out a bit too sour but yours is just scrumptious! I\u2019ll definitely make it again. Thank you. \ud83d\ude42  Reply       Tymeron Smith says  January 31, 2018 at 10:42 am   That is great to hear! Thanks so much for sharing! That makes my day!  Reply         Alexsandra says  January 17, 2018 at 5:43 pm    I used red wine instead of white just because I love the flavor. The mustard was a little bit intense for me, but overall I\u2019d say this is an excellent recipe!  Reply       DeeAnn says  January 09, 2018 at 12:28 pm    Wonderful!!  Probably the best we have ever tasted.  I added extra mushrooms because we love them and used a little more wine.  Reply       Sue Parkinson says  September 02, 2016 at 6:04 am    Made this for tea tonight \u2013 minus the white wine. It turned out really nice.  Reply       Katie says  May 19, 2015 at 9:29 am   Is the wine necessary for the recipe? Is there a substitute I can use?  Reply       Karina says  May 19, 2015 at 9:31 am   Hi Katie! No the wine isn\u2019t necessary \ud83d\ude42 . You can substitute the wine for stock to keep the flavour!  Reply         renxkyoko says  May 17, 2015 at 2:38 am   I just archived tis recipe. Thanks for sharing ! ! ^.^/  Reply       Karina says  May 19, 2015 at 9:32 am   Aw that\u2019s awesome! Thank you. I hope you try it! \ud83d\ude42  Reply         Diane Weiss says  May 14, 2015 at 2:48 pm   I love creamy pasta so much. Actually, i just had it yesterday. I always remind myself to order a new dish whenever i come to that favorite restaurant, but finally it just return to that creamy pasta. I think i\u2019m addicted to it.
