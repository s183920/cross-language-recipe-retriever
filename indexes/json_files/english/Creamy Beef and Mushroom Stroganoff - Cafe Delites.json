Steak in a creamy white wine sauce, served over pasta OR noodles. Your family will go crazy thinking there\u2019s a hidden chef in your kitchen with this\u00a0Creamy Beef and Mushroom Stroganoff!\n\nNo canned soups or ready made packets of anything, and no coating the beef\u00a0with any flour. Just a beautiful, silky cream sauce with a hint of wine aromas gently simmering away on the stove.\u00a0Rivals any restaurant!\u00a0I first shared this recipe three years ago (CD is getting OLD), and readers LOVED it so much back then that I thought I\u2019d fix up the old phots and republish it back with some tips so all of my new readers can make it for dinner!\nThe Best Cut Of Meat For Beef And Mushroom Stroganoff\nI prefer the following beef cuts in this recipe. They stay tender during the cooking process without drying out and causing overly chewy pieces of meat in your sauce.\n\nSirloin\nTenderloin\nEye fillet\nScotch fillet\nFlank steak\n\nBecause there is nothing worse than chewy dried out meat!\n\nWhat Is Stroganoff Sauce Made Of?\nThis version is lightened up with a light or reduced fat sour cream and extra broth (or stock) for MORE SAUCE! There are so many different variations of Beef Stroganoff: some with or without sour cream, and some using brandy instead of wine. During testing, my family, friends and everyone who tried it absolutely loved this version the most.\u00a0I also include Dijon mustard in this one. There\u2019s something about Dijon together with wine in a creamy sauce that warms my soul. Plus paprika and a good hint of garlic, this sauce is pretty much perfection.\n\u00a0\nWhat Is Beef Stroganoff Served With?\n\nEgg noodles (the most popular side)\nPasta (any type: egg fettuccine or angel hair are the most preferred)\nPlain rice\nSpaghetti squash (a low calorie option)\nZoodles (zucchini noodles)\n\n\n*ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED MAY 12, 2015*\nHow To Make\u00a0Creamy Beef and Mushroom Stroganoff!\n\n\n\nCreamy Beef and Mushroom Stroganoff\n\nComfort food at its finest. Pasta and a white wine spiked creamy sauce -- also known as Beef Stroganoff -- ready and on the table in less than 20 minutes. Say, what?! Yes! Weight Watchers: 13pp per serve\n\n\n\n PRINT\n  SAVE   go to your favorites\n\nPrep: 10 minutes minsCook: 30 minutes minsTotal: 40 minutes mins\nServes: 4 - 6 people\n\nIngredients500 g | 1lbs egg Fettuccine (dry weight)4 tablespoons butter, divided1 onion, chopped4 cloves garlic, crushed or minced1 pound (500 grams) sliced mushrooms24 ounces (700 grams) lean beef fillet steaks, seasoned with salt and pepper and cubed into 1 1/2-inch pieces (sirloin, tenderloin, eye fillet or scotch fillet)2  teaspoons dijon mustard1 teaspoon paprika, (smoky or mild)1/3 cup dry white wine, (or more if you like it stronger)2 cups beef broth (or stock), (or 2 cups water mixed with 1 tablespoon vegetable stock powder)2 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauceSalt and pepper to taste1 cup light sour cream at room temperature, (or reduced fat cooking cream)Freshly chopped parsley to garnish\nInstructionsBoil the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water according to packet instructions until al dente. Remove; strain and set aside.While pasta is boiling, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Sear the steak in single layer batches until browned; transfer to a separate plate and set aside until all batches are done.\u00a0Melt the remaining butter in the pan; add the onions and saut\u00e9 until transparent, then add the garlic and fry until just fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are tender and cooked through (about 4 minutes). Mix in the mustard and paprika.Add the wine and cook for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally to mix all of the flavours through, deglazing the pan while scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pan with your spoon. Allow wine to reduce down to about half the amount (about 3 minutes).\u00a0While wine is reducing down, grab a small jug and whisk together the beef broth (or stock), flour and Worcestershire sauce until smooth. Pour the beef broth mixture into the pan, mix well and bring to a simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until the sauce begins to thicken.Return the beef and any juices from the plate to the pan and season with any extra salt and pepper (if desired). Reduce heat down to low and mix in sour cream. Heat until hot (do not boil).Add the pasta or noodles into the pan and garnish with parsley.\nNutritionCalories: 552kcal | Carbohydrates: 62.7g | Protein: 42g | Fat: 10.5g | Fiber: 1.6g\n\nMore Creamy Mushroom Sauce Recipes!\n\nOne-Pot Creamy Mushroom Chicken Pasta (Lightened Up)\nCreamy Parmesan Herb Chicken Mushroom (NO CREAM OPTION)\nPan Seared Garlic Butter Steak & Mushroom Cream Sauce\n\n\n\n\u00ab Lentil SoupMEAL PLAN WEEK #4 \u00bbSubscribe to Cafe Delites FOR FREE and Receive Recipes Straight Into Your Inbox!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReader InteractionsComments\n\n\n\n\nCher says \nSeptember 27, 2020 at 12:01 pm \n\n\nSo I made this last Tuesday and it was another \u201click the pan clean\u201d \u201click the plate clean\u201d s-o good!!!

Thank you!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeannie Gregory says \nMay 24, 2020 at 1:16 pm \n\nSure thing \u2013 wash, cut out the ribs, shred the leaves into fine strips and throw them in five minutes before finished. Great flavour, extra fibre, vitamin C and iron.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKathy says \nNovember 04, 2020 at 9:18 am \n\n\nExcellent recipe! I used cream & half & half instead of the sour cream. Also used stew meat that I marinated for a couple hours before saut\u00e9ing. It came out delicious!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmily Bowman says \nJanuary 23, 2020 at 5:42 pm \n\nLoved it! I made it with ground turkey and it was so good! I like the milkiness of the sauce, extra-thick ones are tasty, but that richness makes you feel so blah later.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnotherMother says \nJanuary 14, 2020 at 7:09 am \n\n\nI made it last night and it was a hit.  We can\u2019t wait for leftovers for tonight. Perfect. I used sirloin sliced thin and baby Bella mushrooms. Thank you!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebra Bour says \nJanuary 11, 2020 at 3:22 am \n\nAbsolutely divine! We will only use this recipe now.

I scaled down to about 3.5 of all ingredients (except pasta (egg noodles), which I used about half). So, soo good. Thank you!!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Mackenzie says \nDecember 29, 2019 at 9:03 pm \n\n\nWow!

It turned out PERFECT and the flavour is exactly right.

We only used half the pasta recommended (and twice the wine ;)) and it was amazing!!!  PS absolutely love your site!!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKathy Ryan says \nApril 11, 2019 at 12:04 pm \n\n\nHubs loved it on egg noodles, and I loved it on spaghetti squash!

Often I use cookbooks because I think if someone is going to pay for a book to be published the recipe are tested and must be good. Karina all your stuff I have made is very tasty. I get tons of compliments. I actually chose to make this recipe  instead of going out for dinner.  My husband said is was amazing ,his favorite. I am excited about cooking again now that I have discovered Cafe Delites!!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer says \nDecember 27, 2018 at 12:28 pm \n\ndoes it need to be a dry white wine, or will just about any white wine work?\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasidy says \nNovember 14, 2018 at 1:16 pm \n\nMade this tonight! Loved the flavor and super simple recipe to follow. Already keep most of these ingredients on hand, so it will be easy to remake anytime!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllison says \nNovember 13, 2018 at 11:41 am \n\nWe loved this dish and it was easy to make!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephanie Magoon says \nNovember 08, 2018 at 3:22 am \n\n\nWe made this last night with egg noodles and it was delicious; the directions were so easy to follow and tonight we are having the remaining sauce/beef over biscuits.\nlove your recipes on this site.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharon says \nNovember 05, 2018 at 2:51 pm \n\nWhen do you add the sour cream? I don\u2019t see that under your instructions.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarina says \nNovember 07, 2018 at 6:48 pm \n\nYou will add in the sour cream at the end in step 6. Hope that helps! XO\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColleen says \nSeptember 02, 2018 at 11:19 am \n\nI used 3 teaspoons of red wine vinegar because I didn\u2019t have any white wine. It was a little runny at the end after I had added the sour cream so I added some cornstarch and it thick and right up. Very tasty and we\u2019ll make again!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShirley says \nJune 14, 2018 at 6:27 am \n\nNothing is awesome if you have searched for the recipe and can\u2019t find it. I can find pictures. But no recipe. Very disappointing\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarina says \nJune 14, 2018 at 7:51 am \n\nHi! I\u2019m so sorry about this. It seems to be a technical issue on mobile only and we are working on it right now. The recipes are on desktop if you need them urgently! Hopefully we will have all recipes up again soon! Thank you for your patience! Karina X\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris says \nApril 05, 2018 at 11:35 am \n\n\nAbsolutely loved the sauce. Delicious and complex. This is my new favorite beef stragonoff recipe and I have tried several! My only problem was the beef turned out tough and chewy. I am a beginning cook but it seems the beef could be braised in the sauce for 30-40 minutes which would make it very tender? Am I missing something? I might try this next go around and hold off on the mushrooms until near the end.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarina says \nApril 06, 2018 at 2:28 pm \n\nI think you did everything right. I do like to use a meat thermometer to help with the cooking of meat. Once it reaches temperature I will take the meat off the heat or cook it according to the recipe. Hope that helps!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanet says \nFebruary 26, 2019 at 12:42 am \n\n\nSome of the recommended cuts can be pretty chewy\u2013the eye of round being one of the toughest on the cow. Sirloins and flank steak are my personal faves for flavor, but I would slice them thin instead of cutting into cubes and cook very lightly, as the recipe states\u2013beef cooked to medium or medium rare is always less chewy than well done. You can also use tenderized cube steaks to get a less tough product. I used a couple of NY strips which I purchased on fantastic sale, sliced thin, similar as for a stir fry\u2013and they were so tender that I could have cubed them. I cooked to medium rare, and they progressed a tad past medium, probably medium well, when added back to the sauce for reheating. The stroganoff was spectacularly good, and I followed the recipe precisely\u2013a rare thing for me. Someone else complained about the sauce being too runny\u2013sour cream can thin or curdle if over heated, so it needs to be added at the very end, again as the recipe states. Another reason for a thin sauce could be that the pasta wasn\u2019t sufficiently drained. The recipe calls for 2 1/3 c of liquid to 2 T of flour which will produce a fairly light sauce, and one that I found perfect, but that could be altered to 3 T of flour for a slightly thicker sauce.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer says \nSeptember 07, 2019 at 10:53 am \n\n\nSo GOOD! I made this with flank steak so I sliced it across the grain and cooked it just rare. It cooked a little more in the sauce but it was still tender and medium well at that point. The sauce was perfect! Thanks!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJade says \nJanuary 30, 2018 at 8:22 am \n\n\nMade this tonight and it\u2019s absolutely gorgeous.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGina Kramer says \nJanuary 22, 2018 at 7:51 am \n\n\nHi Karina, I tried your recipe this evening and it\u2019s really good. Other Stroganoff recipes often turn out a bit too sour but yours is just scrumptious! I\u2019ll definitely make it again. Thank you. \ud83d\ude42\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTymeron Smith says \nJanuary 31, 2018 at 10:42 am \n\nThat is great to hear! Thanks so much for sharing! That makes my day!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexsandra says \nJanuary 17, 2018 at 5:43 pm \n\n\nI used red wine instead of white just because I love the flavor. The mustard was a little bit intense for me, but overall I\u2019d say this is an excellent recipe!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeeAnn says \nJanuary 09, 2018 at 12:28 pm \n\n\nWonderful!!  Probably the best we have ever tasted.  I added extra mushrooms because we love them and used a little more wine.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSue Parkinson says \nSeptember 02, 2016 at 6:04 am \n\n\nMade this for tea tonight \u2013 minus the white wine. It turned out really nice.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie says \nMay 19, 2015 at 9:29 am \n\nIs the wine necessary for the recipe? Is there a substitute I can use?\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarina says \nMay 19, 2015 at 9:31 am \n\nHi Katie! No the wine isn\u2019t necessary \ud83d\ude42 . You can substitute the wine for stock to keep the flavour!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrenxkyoko says \nMay 17, 2015 at 2:38 am \n\nI just archived tis recipe.

I always remind myself to order a new dish whenever i come to that favorite restaurant, but finally it just return to that creamy pasta. I think i\u2019m addicted to it.\n\nReply\n\n\n \nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
