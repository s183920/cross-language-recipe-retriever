I\u2019ve written before about Alex and my eating habits before we met. Basically, I was content to dine on a big salad every night, and on more than one occasion he called peanut butter and graham crackers dinner. But now we are in our mid-30s (gulp) and responsible for feeding not only ourselves healthfully, but a little person as well. And so we eat a lot of broccoli. I\u2019m going to stop right here and admit that while Owen loves broccoli, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese, he would never eat this dish. The foods can\u2019t be touching, they can\u2019t be too hot, and they absolutely cannot have any brown spots (aka the beautiful bits of char broccoli picks up when roasted). Sigh. It\u2019s his loss, because this caprese roasted broccoli is the kind of side that totally steals the show. Crisp-tender garlic roasted broccoli, juicy ripe tomatoes, melted mozzarella cheese, a splash of balsamic, and a shower of fresh basil\u2013what\u2019s not to love?  Even though Owen won\u2019t deign to let this pass his lips, I still consider this an easy weeknight dish my whole family will eat. I just set aside a few plain broccoli florets and sliced tomatoes for him, and then Alex and I enjoy the \u201cfully loaded\u201d version. Simple enough! Plus, the whole thing comes together in about 20 minutes. This is the kind of side that elevates simple school night dinners like rotisserie chicken, roast salmon, or even take-out pizza. Any leftovers are great tossed into tomorrow night\u2019s salad!
