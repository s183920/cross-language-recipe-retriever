This Italian broccoli salad is loaded with your favorite Italian hero fillings, like salami, ham, pepperoncini, mozzarella, and provolone. A flavorful make-ahead lunch!  Italian Sub Broccoli Salad I posted this classic broccoli salad a few weeks ago. This new salad is inspired by an Italian Hero sandwich, turned salad. The bold flavors of an Italian sub come to life in this chopped Italian Broccoli Salad, thanks to broccoli, whose mild flavor doesn\u2019t compete. This adaptable chopped salad packs tons of texture and flavor by\u00a0combining finely chopped raw broccoli, chickpeas, tomatoes, pepperoncini, mozzarella, provolone, salami,\u00a0ham, and turkey. It\u2019s all tossed in a red wine vinaigrette\u00a0that soaks into the\u00a0florets, onlygetting better as it sits.\u00a0Feel free to add your favorite subway meats and toppings to make it your own! For more easy Italian salads, try this Antipasto Salad, and Italian Chopped Salad.   What is Italian broccoli salad made of?  Red Onion: Thinly slice half a small red onion. Broccoli: You\u2019ll need eight cups of broccoli florets from about a pound of broccoli. Cherry Tomatoes: Quarter one cup of tomatoes. Grape tomatoes would also work. Chickpeas: Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas. Mozzarella: Use fresh mozzarella, not pre-shredded. Meat: Diced genoa salami, lean deli ham, deli turkey. Pepperoncini: Slice pepperoncini and use two tablespoons of brine. Broccoli Salad Italian Dressing: Olive oil, red wine vinegar, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, dried oregano.  How to Make Italian Broccoli Salad  Vinaigrette: Combine the onions, a quarter cup of olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, oregano, and black pepper in a large bowl. Add the chickpeas, and let the mixture marinate while you prepare the other ingredients. Salad: Add the meat, veggies, cheese, pepperoncini, and brine to the dressing, and stir in the remaining oil.  Meal Prep Broccoli is tender enough to eat raw but sturdy enough that the dish only gets better after it sits and marinates so that you can eat this Italian broccoli salad for half the week. It lasts about 4 days in the refrigerator, so it\u2019s perfect for meal prep. Variations: Feel free to add anything you like in your Italian sub sandwiches to this healthy broccoli salad.  Olives: Add some sliced black olives Heat: Mix in some pickled jalapenos for spice. More Veggies: Add diced cucumbers, carrots, or roasted red peppers. Swap salami for soppressata or prosciutto. Swap ham for capicola. Lean Meat: Use extra turkey breast and less of the other meats for more lean protein. Vegetarian Broccoli Salad: Omit the meat and add more vegetables. Vinegar: If you like your Italian sub extra juicy, serve the salad with more red wine vinegar at the table.
