to serve with warm scones!  It is nice on pancakes too, served with a bit of whipped cream. Rich and yummy!  If refrigerated, please remove and let stand at room temperature for about 15 minutes to soften before serving. You can use margarine to replace the butter, but butter is best!!

I have to keep reminding myself that this is BUTTER and that I can't just eat it ;).  I made this to go along with chocolate yeast bread (#192544), and I just can't stop eating it!
