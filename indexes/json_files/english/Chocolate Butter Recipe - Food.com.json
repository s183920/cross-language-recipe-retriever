It is nice on pancakes too, served with a bit of whipped cream. Rich and yummy!  If refrigerated, please remove and let stand at room temperature for about 15 minutes to soften before serving. You can use margarine to replace the butter, but butter is best!!\nSource: Chocolatier magazine\"\n    \n\n    \n    \u00a0\n\n\n\nicons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        save\n    \n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\nI Made This\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    photo by queenbeatrice\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady In:\n5mins\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n                        4\n                    \n\n\nYields:\n\n\n3/4 cup\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nutrition information\n        \n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\ningredients\n\n                Units: US\n\n\n\n\n2 \n\n  tablespoons    unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n\n1\u20444\n\n  cup    icing sugar\n\n\n1\u20442\n\n  cup    butter, softened \n\n\n1\u20444\n\n  teaspoon    pure vanilla extract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\ndirections\n\n\nIn a medium bowl, using a hand-held mixer, beat the butter until creamy.\nSift cocoa and icing sugar together, add to butter and mix well.\nAdd vanilla and continue beating for 1 - 2 minutes until mixture is smooth.\nPut blended mixture into small dish and serve.
