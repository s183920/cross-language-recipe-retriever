Here's how you make it:     Cook the Beef and Mushrooms    We start by cooking lean ground beef, finely chopped mushrooms and diced onion in a large skillet in a little bit of oil. Large skillets are perfect for recipes like this, as they have the capacity to cook the ingredients without overcrowding the pan. When using 90% lean ground beef, there is very little fat, which means that you don't need to drain it before moving on to the next step.     Cook the Pasta    The tomato sauce, water, Worcestershire, Italian seasoning, salt and garlic powder are added next and are cooked in the flavors of the beef and mushrooms. Then the pasta is added and brought to a boil. Cover the skillet with a lid, and reduce the heat. Make sure to use a tight-fitting lid to ensure the moisture and heat stays within the skillet to cook the pasta through. Cook until the pasta is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed.     Finish the Dish    We sprinkle the pasta with shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese and cover it until the cheese is melted, then garnish with chopped fresh basil to finish the dish. We love this combination of flavors, but feel free to experiment! Shredded mozzarella cheese, provolone or Asiago would be great substitutes for the Cheddar cheese.    Additional reporting by Jan Valdez             Ingredients    1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil   1 pound 90% lean ground beef   8 ounces mushrooms, finely chopped or pulsed in a food processor   \u00bd cup diced onion   1 15-ounce can no-salt-added tomato sauce   1 cup water   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce   1 teaspoon Italian seasoning   \u00be teaspoon salt   \u00bd teaspoon garlic powder   8 ounces whole-wheat rotini or fusilli   \u00bd cup shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese   \u00bc cup chopped fresh basil for garnish       Directions     Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add beef, mushrooms and onion and cook, stirring, until the beef is no longer pink and the mushroom liquid is mostly evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes.      Stir in tomato sauce, water, Worcestershire, Italian seasoning, salt and garlic powder.      Add pasta. Bring to a boil.      Cover, reduce heat and cook, stirring once or twice, until the pasta is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, 16 to 18 minutes.      Sprinkle the pasta with cheese, cover and cook until the cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes more.      Garnish with basil, if desired.

Percent Daily Value (%DV) found on nutrition labels tells you how much a serving of a particular food or recipe contributes to each of those total recommended amounts. Per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the daily value is based on a standard 2,000 calorie diet. Depending on your calorie needs or if you have a health condition, you may need more or less of particular nutrients. (For example, it\u2019s recommended that people following a heart-healthy diet eat less sodium on a daily basis compared to those following a standard diet.)

If you are following a special diet for medical reasons, be sure to consult with your primary care provider or a registered dietitian to better understand your personal nutrition needs.
