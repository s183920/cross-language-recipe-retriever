Here's how you make it:\n\n\n  Cook the Beef and Mushrooms  \n\nWe start by cooking lean ground beef, finely chopped mushrooms and diced onion in a large skillet in a little bit of oil. Large skillets are perfect for recipes like this, as they have the capacity to cook the ingredients without overcrowding the pan. When using 90% lean ground beef, there is very little fat, which means that you don't need to drain it before moving on to the next step.\n\n\n  Cook the Pasta  \n\nThe tomato sauce, water, Worcestershire, Italian seasoning, salt and garlic powder are added next and are cooked in the flavors of the beef and mushrooms. Then the pasta is added and brought to a boil. Cover the skillet with a lid, and reduce the heat. Make sure to use a tight-fitting lid to ensure the moisture and heat stays within the skillet to cook the pasta through. Cook until the pasta is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed.\n\n\n  Finish the Dish  \n\nWe sprinkle the pasta with shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese and cover it until the cheese is melted, then garnish with chopped fresh basil to finish the dish. We love this combination of flavors, but feel free to experiment! Shredded mozzarella cheese, provolone or Asiago would be great substitutes for the Cheddar cheese.\n\n\n\nAdditional reporting by Jan Valdez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n\n\n1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n\n\n1 pound 90% lean ground beef\n\n\n8 ounces mushrooms, finely chopped or pulsed in a food processor\n\n\n\u00bd cup diced onion\n\n\n1 15-ounce can no-salt-added tomato sauce\n\n\n1 cup water\n\n\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n\n\n1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n\n\n\u00be teaspoon salt\n\n\n\u00bd teaspoon garlic powder\n\n\n8 ounces whole-wheat rotini or fusilli\n\n\n\u00bd cup shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese\n\n\n\u00bc cup chopped fresh basil for garnish\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirections\n\n\n\n\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

Percent Daily Value (%DV) found on nutrition labels tells you how much a serving of a particular food or recipe contributes to each of those total recommended amounts. Per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the daily value is based on a standard 2,000 calorie diet. Depending on your calorie needs or if you have a health condition, you may need more or less of particular nutrients. (For example, it\u2019s recommended that people following a heart-healthy diet eat less sodium on a daily basis compared to those following a standard diet.)\n\n(-) Information is not currently available for this nutrient.
