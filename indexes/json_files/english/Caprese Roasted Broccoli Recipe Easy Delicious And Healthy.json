These are just a few ingredients that encompass the flavors of summer. \u00a0 This Caprese Roasted Broccoli is also roasted with balsamic vinegar and garlic. This is the ultimate summer side dish! \u00a0\n\nThis Caprese Roasted Broccoli is a magical combination of flavors and textures using the fresh ingredients of summer. \u00a0 This is a fantastic dish to bring to any summer barbeque, or you can enjoy it as a healthy meatless meal. Crispy oven-roasted broccoli s one of my favorite vegetable dishes and adding Caprese flavors brings it over the top.\n\nIngredients\nTwo heads of broccoli cut into florets\n1-2 cloves of garlic\n2-3 tablespoons of Olive Oil\nBalsamic Vinegar\nOne teaspoon salt\nOne teaspoon pepper\nfresh garden tomatoes \u2013 heirloom cherry tomatoes,\u00a0 grape tomatoes, or Roma tomatoes will work best.\nslices of fresh mozzarella cheese\n1-2 sprigs of fresh basil\n\nWhy this recipe works\nSheet Pan Roasted broccoli tastes delicious with balsamic vinegar, a key ingredient in Caprese salad. The tomatoes or tomato slices cook on a baking sheet, along with the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, \u00a0and a few springs of Basic. This works best when the mozzarella cheese is added after the broccoli comes out of the oven. This broccoli recipe works so that the fresh mozzarella isn\u2019t melted.\nThis is an excellent side dish to bring to any summer get-together, or you can add some chicken pieces on top to serve as a main meal during tomato season! You can also do this with a variety of green salads.\n\nWays you can switch up this recipe.\nServe over al dente pasta to make a delicious Caprese\u00a0for the main meal.\nAdd pine nuts, cashews, walnuts, almonds, or pistachios\u00a0for some crunch\nTop with ripe avocados\nAdd some boneless chicken breasts to make this an easy Caprese chicken dish.\nSprinkle with fresh parmesan cheese to add even more depth.\nTop with pesto\nTry this recipe with broccoli rabe\n\n\n\n\n\n Print\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n\n\n2\nbunches\nbroccoli \nabout 2 pounds \n\n\n2\ntablespoons\nolive oil \n\n\n2\ntablespoons\nbalsamic vinegar \n\n\n2\ncloves\nminced garlic \n\n\n1.5 \ncups\ngrape tomatoes\n\n\n1\ncup\nfresh mozzarella pieces/slices \n\n\n1-2\nsprigs\nbasil leaves \n\n\nsalt and fresh ground pepper\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees\n\n\nToss the broccoli florets with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, basil, salt, and pepper.
