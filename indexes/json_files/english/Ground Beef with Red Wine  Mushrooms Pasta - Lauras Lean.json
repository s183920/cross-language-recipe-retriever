In a large pot on high heat, boil the pasta according to package directions. Just before draining, set aside 1/2 cup of pasta water for later. Drain and set aside. 2. Meanwhile, in a medium/large pot, add oil, ground beef, onion and garlic and cook about until beef is almost browned. Then add mushrooms. Cook until all brown. 3. Add the marinara sauce, red wine, pasta water, bay leaves and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. 4. Cover and bring to a simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn\u2019t stick. 5. Remove the lid and let simmer 5 minutes. Add the cheese and stir until melted. Add the cooked pasta and fresh basil and stir to combine. Serve. \u00a0      \u2666\ufe0e\u2666\ufe0eSuggested Recipes\u2666\ufe0e\u2666\ufe0e        Red Wine Burgers with Caramelized Onions & Goat Cheese         Ground Beef Superfood Taco Soup         Mediterranean Salad         Ground Beef Jambalaya              Store Locator                          \u00d7 Ground Beef with Red Wine & Mushrooms Pasta Rating   If you would like to add comments about the recipe, please do so below.
