I used the Parmesan\u00a0cheese in a can, but freshly grated Parmesan can be used in the sauce (but not in the breading).\u00a0 I was conservative with the Parmesan cheese but it was just plenty in this recipe.\u00a0 Very flavorful chicken that you will want to make again, and the fact that it is so easy and quick being made in a skillet is a big plus as well.              Ingredients: 2 large chicken breasts   Breading:   4 tbsp Gluten-Free Bake Mix 2 , OR almond flour (60 mL)   2 tbsp Parmesan cheese, kind in a canister (30 mL)   1 / 2 tsp salt (2 mL)   1 / 4 tsp black pepper (1 mL)   Garlic Butter Parmesan Sauce:   2 tbsp butter (30 mL)   3 tbsp crushed garlic (45 mL)   1 1 / 4 cups chicken stock (300 mL)   1 cup whipping cream (250 mL)   1 / 4 cup grated Moz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAMBURGER MUSHROOM BAKE\n\n\n\n       Click ==> To jump to this RECIPE                       HAMBURGER MUSHROOM BAKE    Simple recipe for an easy supper.\u00a0 Although, simple, it was a satiating meal. \u00a0This is loosely based on Mushroom Mozzarella bake recipe...you are welcome to add some Mozzarella cheese before baking.\u00a0 This is a fairly bland casserole, so if you like more zip in your casseroles, please feel free to spice it up!\u00a0\u00a0                  Ingredients:\u00a0  1 lb lean ground beef (0.45 kg)   1 tsp salt (5 mL)   1 / 2\u00a0 tsp black pepper (2 mL)   6 oz cream cheese (180 g)   3 eggs   1 lb mushrooms (0.45 kg)   2 tbsp butter (30 mL)   1 tsp seasoning salt (5 mL)   1 tsp dried parsley (5 mL)   1 / 4\u00a0 tsp black pepper (1 mL)   Grated cheese (optional) Instructions:     Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).     In large frying pan, over medium heat, brown ground beef and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. \u00a0If your ground beef is too dry add some light-tasting olive oil or bacon fat. Set aside to cool.\u00a0     In food processor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMUSHROOM MOZZARELLA BAKE\n\n\n\n       Click ==> To jump to this RECIPE                      WITH SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE INSTEAD OF MOZZARELLA!            MUSHROOM MOZZARELLA BAKE   Very tasty, scalloped, fresh mushrooms! \u00a0I was able to find them at a good price! \u00a0Yay! This is one of my eldest son, Daniel\u2019s favorite dishes. \u00a0Mushrooms are normally quite expensive here. However, I was excited to find them at a good price this week and bought 2 containers. \u00a0I'll make something with chicken breasts tomorrow with the rest. \u00a0Asparagus still remains sooo expensive - about $8 a lb here - too much! \u00a0Even cauliflower for a large to medium head could cost up to $8. \u00a0It's awful, so when I find my fave veggies on sale, I can't help but buy them. The other veggies in the photo on the dinner plate are Butternut Squash Cakes (use any yellow squash) and Sweet Onion Pepper Stir Fry . \u00a0If you have not tried the latter way of cooking peppers and onions, I highly recommend it! \u00a0Although DH prefers them plain and somewhat cr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMISH BROCCOLI SALAD\n\n\n\n           AMISH BROCCOLI SALAD     This delightful salad with my own tweaks lends itself to some wonderful ideas for variations, so be sure to check them out at the bottom of the recipe! This recipe will definitely feed a crowd.\u00a0 The Smoked Gouda  lends an amazing flavor to the salad and would be especially great served at a barbecue. \u00a0The original recipe called for 1/2 cup of sugar. \u00a0Feel free to reduce the sweetener to taste, leave it out, or use your own preferred sweetener.   Note: \u00a0If you prefer, you can blanch the vegetables in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes to take the edge off the crunchiness (especially for the cauliflower (that's why I suggest cutting it real small). \u00a0Then drain the vegetables well in a colander over a bowl.       1 lb chopped broccoli (0.45 kg)   1 lb chopped cauliflower (0.45 kg)   \u00a0 (chopped into very small chunks)   1 / 2\u00a0 lb bacon, fried and crumbled (0.2 kg)   \u00a0 (about 7 slices)   2 cups grated Smoked Gouda, OR (500 mL)   \u00a0 Cheddar cheese, divide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCREAMY CAULIFLOWER, CHEDDAR CHEESE AND BACON\n\n\n\n       Click ==> To jump to this RECIPE        This recipe has been one of the most popular vegetable sides on my blog for a number of years.\u00a0 It has been seen, liked and shared by millions of Facebook Fans, sometimes reaching 2 million people in one posting on our Low-Carbing Among Friends page.     Lovely to be able to use rich creamy sauces on our low-carb diet.\u00a0 This would have been an absolute no-no in our low-fat days.\u00a0 How wrong they have been prove about fat.\u00a0 We absolutely must have even saturated fats in our diets.\u00a0 If you don't believe go to Dr. Eades' blog and do a search there about fats.             CREAMY CAULIFLOWER, CHEDDAR CHEESE AND BACON    Fabulous side dish worthy of company! \u00a0So simple, yet so very tasty. \u00a0This is a pretty side dish with plenty of lovely color. \u00a0I know I'll be serving it to my son, Daniel and his fiance soon. \u00a0They're coming to visit. \u00a0I'm so excited. \u00a0I love it when I have more quality time with family. \u00a0It is so beautiful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFRENCH ONION SMOTHERED CHICKEN BREASTS\n\n\n\n       Click ==> To jump to this RECIPE     \u00a0 FRENCH ONION SMOTHERED CHICKEN BREASTS   A very flavorful meal of chicken breast cutlets with lots of caramelized onions and plenty of fried mushrooms in a generous and delicious gravy.\u00a0 A classic! The tiny bit of thyme gives the sauce a very distinctive flavor.\u00a0 If you are not a fan of thyme, use dried parsley instead.\u00a0 If you use commercial chicken stock which no doubt is quite a bit higher in sodium than my homemade chicken stock, be careful to only lightly salt the chicken breasts.\u00a0 Adding about 1/4 tsp baking soda to a pound of onions helps them caramelize 50% faster!             Ingredients: Olive oil   3 large chicken breasts   \u00a0 (sliced in half\u00a0 longitudinally)   Salt and pepper, to taste, OR seasoning salt \u00a0 (if using commercial chicken stock, go lightly)   4 tbsp butter (60 mL)   3 yellow onions, sliced   8 oz canned mushrooms, drained (250 g) \u00a0 (fresh would be even better)   2 tsp crushed garlic (10 mL)   1 tbsp oat flour, OR \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAMBURGER MUSHROOM BAKE - SUPER DELUXE!\n\n\n\n       Click ==> To jump to this RECIPE                                 HAMBURGER MUSHROOM BAKE - THE SUPER DELUXE VERSION    So happy to share my original Hamburger Mushroom Bake  recipe now improved and, so to speak, on steroids!\u00a0 I asked\u00a0Facebook Fans how we could improve on a fairly simple dish, however, highly popular dish, amazingly, and make it even better! \u00a0There were several lovely suggestions and I incorporated as many of those suggestions as I could with what I had on hand.\u00a0 I used a combination of Swiss cheese and Mozzarella cheese on top.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I added garlic, green onions, bacon and Swiss cheese, increased the amount of ground beef and cream cheese...and TaDa....\u00a0The result was magnificently delicious! \u00a0This dish is now very, very good and tasty. \u00a0I will definitely make it this way in the future. 10 out 10 for our Facebook Fans!! \u00a0 You can double the recipe, if desired and fill two casserole dishes to feed a crowd.

A lovely summer salad! The addition of chicken means it could make a meal, if desired. This recipe will definitely feed a crowd. \u00a0Also, my hubby lost 3 lbs in the week using this recipe. \u00a0He would even have it for breakfast some days.        Ingredients:       1 lb chopped broccoli (0.45 kg)   \u00a0 (chopped into small pieces)   1 lb cooked chicken, chopped (0.45 kg)   \u00a0 (rotisserie chicken is probably easiest)   1 / 2\u00a0 lb bacon, fried and crumbled (0.2 kg)   \u00a0 (about 7 slices)   2 cups grated sharp Cheddar cheese, (500 mL)   \u00a0 divided   1 large apple, chopped finely (optional)   1 cup mayonnaise (250 mL)   1 cup sour cream (250 mL)   Liquid sweetener\u00a0 ( sucralose\u00a0 or\u00a0 stevia )\u00a0 to equal 1 / 4 cup sugar (60 mL)   \u00a0 (optional \u2013 adds no extra carbs)   1 / 2\u00a0 tsp salt, OR to taste (2 mL) Instructions:     In large salad bowl or trifle bowl, combine broc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMONTEREY JACK DIPPING CHIPS \n\n\n\n Out of the oven - crispy and gorgeous!! \u00a0The front chip shows the underside. \u00a0Notice the lovely ribbed pattern that just naturally occurs while the chips bake for 10 minutes.\u00a0         \u00a0Before they go in the oven!                MONTEREY  JACK DIPPING CHIPS      This is such a cool, easy recipe, but it\u2019s not even a recipe as such\u2026it\u2019s simply a method to make really lovely chips for dipping or for spreads out of pure finely shredded Monterey Jack Cheese!\u00a0 When you allow these ribbed (so amazing \u2013 they actually have ribs like real ribbed chips!) chips to cool, they will be crispy and perfect for spreads .\u00a0 Refrigerated, the next day, each chip will be a mix between crispy and chewy and they will be very sturdy to be perfect dipping chips. I can't remember if they were perfect dipping chips freshly made and cooled, but I used them for my spread. I will make them again and let you know soonest!\u00a0\u00a0The day after that, they will still be able to be used to dip, but they will be primarily c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEASY LOW-CARB CHEESE SAUCE \n\n\n\n      CHEESE SAUCE     Here is an easy recipe that is also very tasty.\u00a0 I love to pour it over cooked broccoli or cauliflower for a delicious side dish. \u00a0You can double the recipe easily as well. \u00a0One thing about low-carbing is that tasty, creamy, rich sauces which enhance our food are definitely allowed. \u00a0How bland our low-fat diets were. Remember? \u00a0Most of us who are older have tried low-fat diets like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig. \u00a0The former was okay for weight loss for me (but I was always very hungry and could not wait for my next meal), but Jenny Craig was a disaster. \u00a0Jenny Craig just made me poorer - expensive and it did not work for me. True, I abused the diet as I loved their meal replacement bars, I think it was, which were like candy and probably not a truer word spoken. \u00a0The only other diet I ever tried was the \"Eat all you Can Diet\". \u00a0Yep, my family was in hysterics when I started that one. \u00a0I got a book in a yard sale or somewhere and it suggested that depr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by Blogger\n\n\nJennifer Eloff, Eureka Publishing (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
