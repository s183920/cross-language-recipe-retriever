The eggplant is sliced, pan-fried, and doused in a mouth-watering soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger glaze then topped with optional sliced green onion and sesame seeds.\nEggplant is rich in nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants. A good-for-you, tender, and savory dish that\u2019s vegan, vegetarian, and low in calories. Even the non-veggie lovers will be surprised at how much they enjoy eggplant when paired with the right ingredients, especially if they\u2019re stuffed with melty cheese like our stuffed eggplant parmesan or drizzled in a gorgeous herbed mint sauce from our roasted eggplant recipe.\n\nIngredients you will need\n\nGet all measurements, ingredients, and instructions in the printable version at the end of this post.\n\nIngredient Info and Substitution Suggestions\n\nEGGPLANT \u2013 Choose a small eggplant that is slightly firm to the touch with minimal give. You\u2019ll use cornstarch to dry out the raw eggplant allowing it to crisp while adding texture. Some of the cornstarch will cook off to help thicken the glaze. \nHow to Make Soy Glazed Eggplant\n\n These step by step photos and instructions are here to help you visualize how to make this recipe. You can Jump to Recipe to get the printable version of this recipe, complete with measurements and instructions at the bottom.\n\nTo make the sauce, combine brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. Set aside.\nCut eggplant lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices.\nUsing a sifter, sprinkle cornstarch over both sides of the eggplant slices.\nAdd half of the olive oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high until shimmering.\nAdd eggplant slices, taking care not to crowd them too much. Cook 3-4 minutes. You may need to cook in batches.\nAdd remaining olive oil to the pan, then flip the eggplant slices over and cook an additional 3-4 minutes.\nReduce heat to low. Add sauce to the pan and flip eggplant to coat. You may have to flip several times to get both sides coated. Remove from pan and serve over rice.\nGarnish with sliced green onion and sesame seeds.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions & Expert Tips\n\nHow do I store leftovers? Store leftovers in an air-tight container kept in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.  \n\nServing Suggestions\n\nOptionally dice the eggplant instead of slicing it and serve in a bowl with rice and veggies or enjoy it sliced over a bed of noodles or brown, white, and even cauliflower rice. Don\u2019t forget to garnish with sliced green onions, sesame seeds, or peanuts for the full experience!\nMore Vegetarian Recipes\n\n\nCauliflower Risotto\nMushroom Ravioli\nZucchini Pizza Bites\nSticky Garlic Cauliflower\nEnchilada Stuffed Peppers\nMexican Style Summer Rolls\nSweet Corn and Chickpea Salad\n\nI love to bake and cook and share my kitchen experience with all of you!
