Why this recipe works  This Asian-inspired soy glazed eggplant recipe is easily thrown together in around 20 minutes on the stovetop. The eggplant is sliced, pan-fried, and doused in a mouth-watering soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger glaze then topped with optional sliced green onion and sesame seeds. Eggplant is rich in nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants. A good-for-you, tender, and savory dish that\u2019s vegan, vegetarian, and low in calories. Even the non-veggie lovers will be surprised at how much they enjoy eggplant when paired with the right ingredients, especially if they\u2019re stuffed with melty cheese like our stuffed eggplant parmesan or drizzled in a gorgeous herbed mint sauce from our roasted eggplant recipe.  Ingredients you will need  Get all measurements, ingredients, and instructions in the printable version at the end of this post.  Ingredient Info and Substitution Suggestions  EGGPLANT \u2013 Choose a small eggplant that is slightly firm to the touch with minimal give. You\u2019ll use cornstarch to dry out the raw eggplant allowing it to crisp while adding texture. Some of the cornstarch will cook off to help thicken the glaze.

You can Jump to Recipe to get the printable version of this recipe, complete with measurements and instructions at the bottom.  To make the sauce, combine brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. Set aside. Cut eggplant lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices. Using a sifter, sprinkle cornstarch over both sides of the eggplant slices. Add half of the olive oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high until shimmering. Add eggplant slices, taking care not to crowd them too much. Cook 3-4 minutes. You may need to cook in batches. Add remaining olive oil to the pan, then flip the eggplant slices over and cook an additional 3-4 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add sauce to the pan and flip eggplant to coat. You may have to flip several times to get both sides coated. Remove from pan and serve over rice. Garnish with sliced green onion and sesame seeds.  Frequently Asked Questions & Expert Tips  How do I store leftovers? Store leftovers in an air-tight container kept in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.    Serving Suggestions  Optionally dice the eggplant instead of slicing it and serve in a bowl with rice and veggies or enjoy it sliced over a bed of noodles or brown, white, and even cauliflower rice. Don\u2019t forget to garnish with sliced green onions, sesame seeds, or peanuts for the full experience!
