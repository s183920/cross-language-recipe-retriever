Furikake is a dry Asian condiment containing seaweed, sugar, salt and sesame seeds, meant to be sprinkled on rice.   So it all started one day when I was reading The Steamy Kitchen Cookbook by Jaden Hair. I saw a recipe called Furikake French Fries. I thought, Hm - this furikake stuff sounds good. I mean, it's just a seasoning blend. What could be so bad about that?  Now, fast forward about two years. Mom had come home from a date with Dad with an array of weird Asian groceries. [Yes, this is what we do on our dates - go grocery shopping.] I was looking through them, as I always do, and I found...furikake! I wanted to use it right away, but alas, there was nothing on which to put it.  Now, fast forward another week. I told Mom I was hungry - we were out after our weekly farmers' market run. She said, \"Have a salad.\" I said, \"If I'm going to have a salad, I want spinach.\" Naturally, she said we didn't have any. I managed to wangle a trip to the 99 Cents Only store to get some bagged baby spinach, and on the way home we constructed this recipe using leftover rice from takeout Chinese, the spinach and the furikake. We added a few more things we happened to have around the house: garlic, red chili flakes, ponzu sauce. It turned into a masterpiece. I've made it a half-dozen times since then, at all hours of the day and night.  Erika again: This photo shows white rice, but Emery usually makes it with precooked brown rice. I like the brown; Emery will take white rice when he can get it.

Use more spinach than you think you need - it shrinks a lot as it cooks.        Ingredients  1 Tbsp   grapeseed oil 1 cup   cooked brown or white rice 1/8 tsp   red chili pepper flakes 4 cloves   garlic, chopped 1 5-ounce package   baby spinach 1 Tbsp   furikake seasoning, or to taste 1 Tbsp   ponzu sauce     Instructions  Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil, rice and chili flakes. Stir-fry until the rice is starting to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and spinach and continue to stir-fry until the spinach is wilted. Remove the pan from the heat, turn the spinach mixture onto a plate, garnish with the furikake, and sprinkle over the ponzu sauce. Serve immediately.
