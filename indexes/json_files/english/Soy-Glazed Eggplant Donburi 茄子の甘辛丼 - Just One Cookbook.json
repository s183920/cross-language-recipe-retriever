Try my delicious Soy-Glazed Eggplant Donburi. I sear meaty eggplant slices until golden brown and silky, coat them with a sweet and salty sauce, and serve over hot steamed rice. It\u2019s a satisfying Japanese vegan rice bowl that deserves a spot at your weeknight table.\u00a0{gluten-free adaptable}\u00a0\n\nWhat do you consider a quick meal? For me, anything cooks in one pot or one pan are most ideal. That\u2019s why I often turn to Japanese rice bowls (donburi) when I need something fast and easy-to-assemble. Today\u2019s recipe is Soy Glazed Eggplant Donburi (\u8304\u5b50\u306e\u7518\u8f9b\u4e3c), which happens to be plant-based!\nEggplant Rice Bowl \u2013 The Most Luxurious Vegan Donburi\nEggplant is undoubtedly the star ingredient that makes the appeal of this rice bowl. Think of it as the tofu of the vegetable world. It is mild and versatile, and it has the ability to take on almost any flavor. What sets eggplant apart from other vegetables is its unique structural integrity, and at the same time, its silky, meaty, and utterly luxurious texture.\nThat said, it\u2019s very important to cook it right. Here, searing the eggplant until nicely charred delivers the best, deepest flavor. It also renders a buttery tender texture with a crispy edge that is hard to resist. When tossed with a quick sauce of mirin and soy sauce, it makes the most satisfying one-bowl comfort that requires minimal effort.\nI could easily cook and eat this eggplant donburi over and over again!\n\n3 Tips to Follow When Cooking the Eggplant\n1. Keep the eggplant skin\nEggplant flesh gets tender and soft when it\u2019s cooked through, and if you cook it for too long, the flesh gets mushy. Therefore, it\u2019s very important to:\n\nKeep the eggplant skin attached to the flesh to maintain its shape.\nCut the eggplant so the flesh is held by the skin.\n\nFor this purpose, I only recommend using Japanese, Chinese, or Italian eggplant. If you use American/glove eggplant, cut into the wedges and use only the part that has skin (and use the middle part for other recipes).\n2. Sprinkle salt\nEggplant has soft, spongy flesh with tiny air pockets that acts like a sponge in soaking up oil and liquids. While we like the eggplant to absorb all the good flavors, the challenge is to prevent it from becoming greasy.\nThe trick to that is by breaking down the air pockets and reducing the sponginess by salting the eggplant first. Salting also prevents the eggplant from discoloring.\nJust make sure to wipe off the excess water before frying.\n3. Use potato starch/cornstarch\nCoating the eggplant with potato starch (or cornstarch) can help:\n\nPrevents the eggplant from soaking up all the oil.\nCreates a nice golden crust.\nAbsorbs all the seasonings.\nThickens the sauce slightly.\n\nMake sure to remove the excess potato starch and applies only a thin coating.\n\nItadakimasu!\nEggplant skeptics? This Soy-Glazed Eggplant Donburi might change your mind. I hope you give this nightshade vegetable a chance to reveal its deliciousness to you through this recipe. Once tried, you will not get enough of it.\nTo enjoy this vegan rice bowl, serve it with miso soup and a side of pickle.

For the steamed rice, please note that 1\u00bd cups (300 g, 2 rice cooker cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice yield 4\u2153 cups (660 g) of cooked rice, enough for 2 donburi servings (3\u2153 cups, 500 g). See how to cook short-grain rice with a\u00a0rice cooker,\u00a0pot over the stove,\u00a0Instant Pot, or\u00a0donabe. Slice 2 Japanese or Chinese eggplants lengthwise into \u00bc-inch slices. Then, sprinkle with \u00bd\u20131 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt. Set aside for 15 minutes, then wipe off the moisture with a paper towel. Rinse 10 shiso leaves (perilla/ooba) and pat dry with a paper towel. Cut off and discard the stems. Roll up the shiso leaves and cut them into chiffonade strips. Peel the ginger skin and grate the ginger (I use a\u00a0ceramic grater). Then, measure 1 tsp ginger (grated, with juice) and set aside. Put 2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch in a small tray. Then, thinly coat both sides of the eggplant slices with the potato starch. To CookHeat a frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add 2 Tbsp of the 4 Tbsp neutral oil and distribute it in the pan. Then, add the eggplant slices in a single layer. Cook until the bottom side is golden brown, about 3\u20134 minutes. Until then, do not touch the eggplants in order to achieve a nice sear. When the bottom side is nicely seared, drizzle another 2 Tbsp of the oil on top of the eggplant and flip the slices to cook the other side for an additional 3\u20134 minutes. Once the second side is cooked to a golden brown color, reduce the heat to medium low. Add 4 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, and grated ginger. Bring it back to a simmer and spoon the sauce over the eggplant a few times. If the sauce thickens too fast (due to the potato starch), add 1 Tbsp water at a time to loosen it a bit. Remove from the heat when the eggplant is well-coated with the sauce.  To ServeIn individual donburi bowls (a bit bigger than rice bowls), divide the 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice and drizzle some sauce on top of the rice. Then, place the eggplant slices on top. For presentation, I overlap each slice slightly. Garnish on top with \u00bd tsp toasted white sesame seeds and shiso leaves. Serve immediately. To StoreYou can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and keep them for 3 days in the refrigerator or for up to a month in the freezer.\nNutrition\n\nNutrition FactsSoy-Glazed Eggplant DonburiAmount per ServingCalories363% Daily Value*Fat\u00a029g45%Saturated Fat\u00a023g144%Sodium\u00a0679mg30%Potassium\u00a0341mg10%Carbohydrates\u00a017g6%Fiber\u00a04g17%Sugar\u00a010g11%Protein\u00a03g6%Vitamin A\u00a023IU0%Vitamin C\u00a03mg4%Calcium\u00a020mg2%Iron\u00a01mg6%* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet.\n\nAuthor: Nami\nCourse: Main CourseCuisine: JapaneseKeyword: donburi, eggplant\n\n\n\u00a9JustOneCookbook.com Content and photographs are copyright protected.

Store does provide some exotic veggies, but problem tends to be that at normal price people are hesitant to try for example japanese eggplants or similar. Seasoned users are a bit scarse in \u201crural\u201d Finland. But, others loss, my win, this was \u201coishii\u201d. Will hunt for nasu after this experience. \ud83d\ude42\nI probably lost some authencity from the taste, as I had to use some dry cider with a little sugar instead of mirin, but as already mentioned it is was still delicious. I cut the eggplant to buttons but probably try the lenghtwise cut next time, and tossed the pieces in potato starch, fried to a beautifull color. I used some leftovers as garnish on butternut squash soup next day, worked great on it, so thumbs up for versatility of the dish.\nSo, thank you for sharing the recipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Naomi (JOC Community Manager)\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reply to\u00a0\n    \n        Mikko Keppo\n    \n\n\n\n    1 month ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Mikko!

I just cooked eggplant for the first time (not the first time I ate it) and I loved it (I normally don\u2019t like it)! It was absolutely sensational! Still have more eggplant and will try your other recipes. Thanks for changing my view on eggplant! I\u2019m now an absolute fan! BTW I just had my first trip to Japan early this month with my bf and it was lovely! I was so fascinated by authentic Japanese cuisine and was living my otaku dream. We came back home and did lots of research on Japanese food so now we are experimenting/trying recipes A LOT! FYI my bf works with edible insects and he has been making cricket tsukudani. After the trip, we started trying to make cricket furikake and it was a delight! (We actually ate it with this eggplant dish tonight). I really can\u2019t wait to have ochazuke with it! Anyways long story short, I also can\u2019t wait to try all of your recipes if I could! We are based in Taiwan and luckily Japanese ingredients are not so difficult to find. I however struggle to perfect cooking short grain rice the Japanese way, still come out bit too wet, unlike the perfect rice we had in Japan. Perhaps the variety here is different, I\u2019ll continue working on this quest! \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Naomi (JOC Community Manager)\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reply to\u00a0\n    \n        Linh Nguyen\n    \n\n\n\n    7 months ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello, Linh!
