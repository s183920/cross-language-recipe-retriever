PLEASE SEE MY FULL DISCLOSURE POLICY FOR DETAILS. AS AN AMAZON ASSOCIATE I EARN FROM QUALIFYING PURCHASES.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to Recipe\u00b7Print Recipe\n\n\nThis is a quick and easy creamy mushroom pasta recipe with white button mushrooms, cremini mushrooms, garlic, and fresh thyme, all in a rich, creamy beef broth.  This is a mushroom lovers dream come true and the perfect side for steak, roasted chicken, or grilled fish. \nSometimes I just serve this scrumptious dish as the main course with a simple garden salad and Cheese Garlic Bread.  Make it a vegetarian-friendly meal by substituting vegetable broth for the beef broth.\n\nHow to make mushroom pasta\nStart by melting the butter and heating the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until their juices release, and they are golden brown. Reduce the heat to low and add the garlic, cooking for a minute while stirring constantly.  Plate the mushrooms and garlic mixture and add the beef broth scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any brown bits. Then add the cream, fresh thyme, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a gentle boil and then simmer for about 10-15 minutes. \n\nMeanwhile, boil the fettuccine pasta according to the package directions and drain well.  Once the sauce is simmered down, turn the heat as low as it will go.  Then slowly stir in the parmesan cheese until melted.  Add the cooked pasta and mushrooms to the skillet and toss to coat. Stir over low heat until warmed through.  If desired, top with chopped fresh parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. \n\nMushroom pasta recipe notes and helpful tips \n\nI like to rinse my mushrooms to remove the dirt, but I dry them thoroughly and quickly with a paper towel.  I work in small batches so the mushrooms do not stay wet for more than a minute. \nUse\u00a0white button mushrooms, cremini\u00a0mushrooms\u00a0(also known as\u00a0baby bellas, oyster mushrooms, or even\u00a0shiitake mushrooms\u00a0but remove the tough stems on\u00a0shiitakes.\u00a0\nFresh thyme is one of my favorite herbs with a bright green color.  It tastes refreshing, with a slightly minty flavor that complements the mushrooms. \nTry to time the pasta to be done when the sauce is ready. Pasta gets kind of sticky and pasty if it sits in the colander too long.  \nThis recipe is best served promptly, However, if time doesn\u2019t permit, reheat over low heat on the stovetop. \nTry a variety of added veggies like broccoli, asparagus, brussels sprouts, spinach, or\u00a0zucchini. \u00a0\nStore leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.  Reheat on the stovetop in a skillet over low heat or in the microwave at reduced power. \n\nHow to cook mushrooms for pasta\nWash or wipe the mushrooms clean and dry them thoroughly with a paper towel.  Slice them fairly thick, as the moisture will be cooked out of them while browning them.  Melt some butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and increase the heat to medium-high.  Cook the mushrooms stirring a couple of times, until golden brown.  You may see the mushroom exude a lot of moisture, but just keep cooking until the moisture cooks off and the mushrooms are golden brown. \n\nMore mushroom recipes you will love!\nCrab Stuffed MushroomsSaut\u00e9ed Mushrooms and Onions Chicken and MushroomsFried MushroomsBeef and NoodlesChicken Chop Suey\nPrint\n\nMushroom Pasta\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrint Recipe\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n5 from 16 reviews\n\n\n\nA simple Creamy Mushroom Pasta dish made with cremini and white button mushrooms, garlic, beef broth, heavy cream, and a few fresh herbs and spices.

You could use half n half but then you will need to add a cornstarch or flour slurry to thicken it.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Williams \nJune 03, 2023 at 6:46 am \n\nI just came across your site and I\u2019m certainly glad I did.
