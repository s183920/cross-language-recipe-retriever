Right now there are three food mantras in my life. Vegetables, calcium and flavor. And today\u2019s Broccoli Cheese casserole hits all three! With two vegetables and two cheeses, it\u2019s a bonanza of often shorted-changed nutrients! And did I mention the whole family loves it?\u00a0  You see I\u2019ve never believed in eating a food \u201cbecause it\u2019s good for you.\u201d I do try to avoid foods that are unhealthy, but I want to eat out of love as well as health. And this seriously has both!  What is a Gratinata? This recipe began life as a green been casserole based on a recipe from Lidia Bastianich, who called it a Gratinata. Not familiar with the term?\u00a0 According to eHow, \u201cto prepare a dish au gratin or as a gratinata is to finish it with a generous sprinkling of cheese, breadcrumbs and butter prior to baking.\u201d Sounds like a formula for tasty to me! We liked the green bean original so much, I needed an excuse to serve it more often. And that\u2019s how this Broccoli Cheese Casserole was born!  Why You\u2019ll Love This! Delicious. Loaded with cheese and some great Italian seasonings, you don\u2019t even need to be a vegetable fan to think this is delicious! Healthy. Lots of calcium.\u00a0 Two veggies. Olive oil instead of butter. It will even make vegetarians happy. \u2018Nuf said? Versatile. This has everything you need for either a side dish or a main dish. While we started eating the original as a Thanksgiving green bean casserole substitute, it quickly grew beyond its original role!  What You\u2019ll Need Ingredient Notes  Broccoli Florets.\u00a0 This is the main ingredient in the dish. Grape or Cherry Tomatoes. This adds freshness and extra nutrition. Fresh Mozzarella. This adds rich cheesy goodness.\u00a0 I use the small round balls if I can find them.\u00a0 Otherwise I\u2019ll cut up a log or large ball into bite-sized pieces. Fresh Basil.\u00a0 Adds flavor.\u00a0 You can use 1 Tablespoon of dried basil if you can\u2019t get fresh. Grated Fresh Parmesan.\u00a0 This adds more cheesy flavor and a punch of umami! Salt.\u00a0 Adds flavor. Italian Bread Crumbs.\u00a0 Enhances the flavor and adds a little crunch.\u00a0 My homemade Italian Breadcrumbs are easy to make if you happen to be out.\u00a0 Or consult that recipe and add some herbs to plain breadcrumbs.\u00a0 For keto / low-carb / gluten-free, you can use crushed pork rinds mixed with Italian Seasoning. Extra Virgin Olive Oil.\u00a0 Enhances the flavor, adds richness and moisture, helps the dish brown.  Special Tools  You\u2019ll need a medium casserole dish or smaller Dutch oven for baking.  Step by Step Directions Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli, bring back to a boil and cook for a couple minutes until still slightly crunchy, . Drain the broccoli and run under cool water to cool. Place half of the broccoli, tomatoes, mozzarella, salt and basil in the casserole. Toss to combine, then top with half of the olive oil, Parmesan and bread crumbs (or crushed pork rinds for keto / low-carb).  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.  Bake covered, then take off the cover when almost done to brown. Casserole is done when everything is warm and broccoli is tender. Enjoy. How to Serve One of the delights of this Broccoli Cheese Casserole is that works well as a side or an entr\u00e9e! As a side dish, it goes well with just about any meat or poultry entr\u00e9e. I especially like it with more basic entr\u00e9es like Dutch Oven Roast Chicken or pork chops since it adds welcome flare to the meal. I\u2019ve even served it at lunch as a side to a small sandwich or hearty soup. When I serve Broccoli Cheese Casserole as an entr\u00e9e, I usually let it stand solo\u2014with all that cheese there\u2019s little chance of feeling deprived! But a nice crusty bread or an herbed biscuit would also be delicious. And if it\u2019s dinner time and we haven\u2019t had our \u201cfive-a-day\u201d (servings of fruit and vegetables), I may even add a simple green salad.  Variations If you love this as much as I do, you might want to try the Green Bean Casserole as well! Going low carb or keto? Go with crushed pork rinds instead of the bread crumbs. They\u2019re delicious! Just add in some extra Italian seasonings to turn them into low carb Italian \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d\u00a0 (see my recipe for suggestions). Prep & Leftovers To streamline your preparation, you can lightly pre-cook your broccoli and cool it ahead of time. Be sure to only partially cook it or it will be overly soft in the final dish. Or use frozen broccoli, which you don\u2019t need to pre-cook, just thaw and add. Though I haven\u2019t tried it, I suspect you could even pre-assemble the whole casserole the day before except for the final bread crumbs. Store leftovers covered and eat within a few days. If you need to freeze leftovers, they will be softer when thawed. In that case, I\u2019d reheat and top with a fried egg or two for a nice breakfast.  Tips & FAQs The biggest risk in this casserole is overcooking the broccoli. I very briefly pre-cook raw broccoli but thaw and use frozen broccoli without any pre-cooking. A good test for doneness is to first check that the cheese is softened\u2013it doesn\u2019t need to fully melt. Then check a cherry tomato to see if it is heated through and test that the broccoli is tender. I especially love preparing this in the fall\u2014the bountiful days of stuffed CSA boxes or overzealous farmers market trips. You can clear out a refrigerator full of broccoli and cherry tomatoes pretty quickly!
