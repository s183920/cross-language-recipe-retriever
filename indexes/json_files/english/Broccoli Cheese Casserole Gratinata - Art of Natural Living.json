Vegetables, calcium and flavor. And today\u2019s Broccoli Cheese casserole hits all three! With two vegetables and two cheeses, it\u2019s a bonanza of often shorted-changed nutrients!\nAnd did I mention the whole family loves it?\u00a0 \nYou see I\u2019ve never believed in eating a food \u201cbecause it\u2019s good for you.\u201d I do try to avoid foods that are unhealthy, but I want to eat out of love as well as health. And this seriously has both!\n\nWhat is a Gratinata?\nThis recipe began life as a green been casserole based on a recipe from Lidia Bastianich, who called it a Gratinata. Not familiar with the term?\u00a0\nAccording to eHow, \u201cto prepare a dish au gratin or as a gratinata is to finish it with a generous sprinkling of cheese, breadcrumbs and butter prior to baking.\u201d\nSounds like a formula for tasty to me!\nWe liked the green bean original so much, I needed an excuse to serve it more often. And that\u2019s how this Broccoli Cheese Casserole was born!\n\nWhy You\u2019ll Love This!\nDelicious. Loaded with cheese and some great Italian seasonings, you don\u2019t even need to be a vegetable fan to think this is delicious!\nHealthy. Lots of calcium.\u00a0 Two veggies. Olive oil instead of butter. It will even make vegetarians happy. \u2018Nuf said?\nVersatile. This has everything you need for either a side dish or a main dish. While we started eating the original as a Thanksgiving green bean casserole substitute, it quickly grew beyond its original role!\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Need\nIngredient Notes\n\nBroccoli Florets.\u00a0 This is the main ingredient in the dish.\nGrape or Cherry Tomatoes. This adds freshness and extra nutrition.\nFresh Mozzarella. This adds rich cheesy goodness.\u00a0 I use the small round balls if I can find them.\u00a0 Otherwise I\u2019ll cut up a log or large ball into bite-sized pieces.\nFresh Basil.\u00a0 Adds flavor.\u00a0 You can use 1 Tablespoon of dried basil if you can\u2019t get fresh.\nGrated Fresh Parmesan.\u00a0 This adds more cheesy flavor and a punch of umami!\nSalt.\u00a0 Adds flavor.\nItalian Bread Crumbs.\u00a0 Enhances the flavor and adds a little crunch.\u00a0 My homemade Italian Breadcrumbs are easy to make if you happen to be out.\u00a0 Or consult that recipe and add some herbs to plain breadcrumbs.\u00a0 For keto / low-carb / gluten-free, you can use crushed pork rinds mixed with Italian Seasoning.\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil.\u00a0 Enhances the flavor, adds richness and moisture, helps the dish brown.\n\nSpecial Tools\n\nYou\u2019ll need a medium casserole dish or smaller Dutch oven for baking.\n\nStep by Step Directions\nFill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli, bring back to a boil and cook for a couple minutes until still slightly crunchy, . Drain the broccoli and run under cool water to cool.\nPlace half of the broccoli, tomatoes, mozzarella, salt and basil in the casserole. Toss to combine, then top with half of the olive oil, Parmesan and bread crumbs (or crushed pork rinds for keto / low-carb).\n\nRepeat with the remaining ingredients.\n\nBake covered, then take off the cover when almost done to brown. Casserole is done when everything is warm and broccoli is tender.\nEnjoy.\nHow to Serve\nOne of the delights of this Broccoli Cheese Casserole is that works well as a side or an entr\u00e9e!\nAs a side dish, it goes well with just about any meat or poultry entr\u00e9e. I especially like it with more basic entr\u00e9es like Dutch Oven Roast Chicken or pork chops since it adds welcome flare to the meal. I\u2019ve even served it at lunch as a side to a small sandwich or hearty soup.\nWhen I serve Broccoli Cheese Casserole as an entr\u00e9e, I usually let it stand solo\u2014with all that cheese there\u2019s little chance of feeling deprived! But a nice crusty bread or an herbed biscuit would also be delicious. And if it\u2019s dinner time and we haven\u2019t had our \u201cfive-a-day\u201d (servings of fruit and vegetables), I may even add a simple green salad.\n\nVariations\nIf you love this as much as I do, you might want to try the Green Bean Casserole as well!\nGoing low carb or keto? Go with crushed pork rinds instead of the bread crumbs. They\u2019re delicious! Just add in some extra Italian seasonings to turn them into low carb Italian \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d\u00a0 (see my recipe for suggestions).\nPrep & Leftovers\nTo streamline your preparation, you can lightly pre-cook your broccoli and cool it ahead of time. Be sure to only partially cook it or it will be overly soft in the final dish. Or use frozen broccoli, which you don\u2019t need to pre-cook, just thaw and add.\nThough I haven\u2019t tried it, I suspect you could even pre-assemble the whole casserole the day before except for the final bread crumbs.\nStore leftovers covered and eat within a few days. If you need to freeze leftovers, they will be softer when thawed. In that case, I\u2019d reheat and top with a fried egg or two for a nice breakfast.\n\nTips & FAQs\nThe biggest risk in this casserole is overcooking the broccoli. I very briefly pre-cook raw broccoli but thaw and use frozen broccoli without any pre-cooking.\nA good test for doneness is to first check that the cheese is softened\u2013it doesn\u2019t need to fully melt. Then check a cherry tomato to see if it is heated through and test that the broccoli is tender.\nI especially love preparing this in the fall\u2014the bountiful days of stuffed CSA boxes or overzealous farmers market trips. You can clear out a refrigerator full of broccoli and cherry tomatoes pretty quickly!\nAnd for more ideas for #DairyMonth check out:\n\nAsiago Cheese Bagels by Karen\u2019s Kitchen Stories\nBerry Cream Pops by Jolene\u2019s Recipe Journal\nBroccoli Cheese Casserole by Art of Natural Living\nGochujang Paneer Bowl by Magical Ingredients\nLemon-Blueberry Cheesecake Shake by A Little Fish in the Kitchen\nMacaroni Salad Caprese by Palatable Pastime\nMilk Cookies by A Day in the Life on the Farm\nNo Churn Blueberry Ice Cream by Hezzi-D\u2019s Books and Cooks\nOne Pot Garlic Parmesan Chicken Pasta by Hostess At Heart\nPimento Cheese Mac and Cheese by A Kitchen Hoor\u2019s Adventures\nReese Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream by Blogghetti\nSlow Cooker Cream Cheese Chili Chicken by Cheese Curd In Paradise\nS\u2019mores Ice Cream by Jen Around the World\nSummer Fruit Tortillas by The Freshman Cook\nVanilla Bean-Nutmeg Milkshake with Blackberry Swirl by The Spiffy Cookie\n\n\n\n\nBroccoli Cheese Casserole (Gratinata)\n\n\nWith two kinds of creamy cheese, tender broccoli & fresh cherry tomatoes, this Broccoli Cheese Casserole is a tasty & healthy entree or side.\nAuthor: Inger\n\n5 from 2 votes\n\n\n Print \n\n \nPrep Time 20 minsCook Time 25 minsTotal Time 45 mins\n\n\n \nCourse Vegetable\n\n\n \nServings 8Calories 237 kcal\n\n\nIngredients\u00a0\u00a01x2x3x6-8 cups broccoli florets depending on casserole dish size1 pint grape tomatoes or cherry8 ounces fresh mozzarella sliced into 1-inch cubes (or small fresh mozzarella balls)6-8 basil leaves sliced thinly or 1 Tablespoon dried basil1 cup grated Parmesan1/2 teaspoon sea salt1/3 cup Italian bread crumbs or crushed pork rinds for keto / low-carb or gluten free3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\nInstructions\u00a0Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over high heat.
