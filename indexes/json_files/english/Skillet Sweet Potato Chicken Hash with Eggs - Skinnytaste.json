Read my disclosure policy.This hearty sweet potato hash recipe with chicken and eggs is perfect for breakfast, brunch or breakfast for dinner!  Sweet Potato Chicken Hash with Eggs I love the combination of sweet potatoes with chicken and eggs in this savory dish. The sweet potatoes are sauteed with onions and thyme that make the whole dish feel like fall. It\u2019s delicious, and a great way to use up any leftovers from a rotisserie chicken. Top it with a few dashes of Sriracha or Franks hot sauce and it\u2019s over-the-top good!   It\u2019s also the perfect one pot dish, start to finish it\u2019s made all in one skillet. So that means there\u2019s also less dishes to wash \u2013 a win in my book! Variations  Leftover turkey would also be great in place of chicken. For time-saving convenience, you can use pre-cut sweet potatoes. Switch up the herbs by using Herbs de Provence, sage or rosemary in place of thyme.
