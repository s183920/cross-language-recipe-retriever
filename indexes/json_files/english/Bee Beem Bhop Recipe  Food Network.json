bowl\n  \n\n\n\n\n              Boil water and add spinach for 2 minutes. Remove and place in ice cold water, then strain for 1 minute. Add a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar. Set aside.\n            \n\n              Repeat this method individually with the sprouts, zucchini, carrot, mushroom, cabbage and radish, then set aside.\n            \n\n              Soak some salted green seaweed in water for 10 minutes, then strain. Repeat this process of soaking the seaweed and straining 2 more times. Cut seaweed into small pieces (approximately 2 inches). Add oil to a pan and saute seaweed with a pinch of salt and pinch of sugar for 2 minutes.\n            \n\n              Coat a stone pot bowl with butter. Add the rice and thinly spread it across the bowl.\n            \n\n              Add the spinach, sprouts, zucchini, carrot, mushroom, cabbage, radish and seaweed, arranging in wedges going around the bowl (like a pie) and leaving the rice visible in the middle. Put the egg yolk in this middle hole.\n            \n\n              Place the stone pot over high heat until cooked to your desired crispiness, 7 to 10 minutes.\n            \n\n              If you like extra crispiness, squeeze an extra layer of sesame oil around the rim of the stone pot so that the rice does not burn.\n            \n\n              Garnish bee beem bhop with sesame oil, sesame seeds and dried seasoned seaweed. You can also add gochujang for spiciness.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools You May Need\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice and stock may change after publish date, and we may make money off\n        these links.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis recipe was provided by a chef, restaurant or culinary professional.
