For details, see the Privacy Policy.\n\nJump to Recipe\n\nThis flavor-packed pan-fried eggplant is inspired by Chinese and Japanese flavors. Serve hot or at room temperature, over rice or as a side dish.\n \nOne of the vegetables I get the most questions about is eggplant (a.k.a. aubergine to my friends across the pond). And I totally get the confusion. Unlike, say, potatoes, cooking with eggplant is not very intuitive. But luckily, it\u2019s also not rocket science. In my experience, the easiest way to cook eggplant is in a pan on the stove.\nThis flavor-packed pan-fried eggplant is inspired by dishes I\u2019ve had in Chinese and Japanese restaurants. (Unlike many other eggplant recipes, this one has no breading.) It has a creamy texture, caramelized flavor, and gets coated in a savory-salty soy sauce glaze with garlic, ginger, and red onion; crushed peanuts and cilantro crown the top. It\u2019s so good and rich, you may be temped to eat the whole skillet by yourself. (Been there, done that.)\nJump To\u2026showWhat\u2019s In This Pan-Fried EggplantHow to Make Pan-Fried Eggplant with Soy GlazeWhy You Should Salt EggplantTo Peel or Not To PeelWatch the VideoHow to Serve Soy-Glazed EggplantMore Eggplant RecipesThe Full Recipe\n \nWhat\u2019s In This Pan-Fried Eggplant\nThis dish consists of eggplant that gets deeply browned in a skillet, then removed. In that same pan, you then quickly saut\u00e9 red onions, garlic, ginger, and chili flakes, and turn them into a glaze by adding soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Finally, you return the eggplant to the pan and toss it in the glaze. The dish gets garnished with crushed peanuts and cilantro.\nHow to Make Pan-Fried Eggplant with Soy Glaze\nStep 1: Salt the Eggplant\nCut the eggplant into chunks and place in a colander, sprinkling each layer generously with salt. Set aside for 15 to 30 minutes (this helps tame the eggplant\u2019s bitterness \u2013 more details below). When the eggplant looks sweaty, transfer it to a kitchen towel and pat dry.\n\n \n \n\nStep 2: Pan Fry the Eggplant\nWorking in two batches, cook the eggplant in a single layer in a pan over medium heat until deeply golden. To prevent it from turning out greasy \u2013 and to speed up the softening process \u2013 cover the skillet with a lid while searing. Resist the urge to move/flip the eggplant more than necessary, as it is prolonged contact with the hot pan that will give you that delicious caramelization. Remove all the eggplant from the pan and set aside.\n \nStep 3: Glaze the Eggplant\nCook the onion, garlic, ginger, and chili flakes in that same skillet for just a few minutes, then add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Finally, add all the eggplant back in, toss to coat it in the glaze, and turn the heat off. Sprinkle with crushed peanuts and cilantro before serving.\n \nWhy You Should Salt Eggplant\nEggplant naturally contains a lot of moisture and some bitterness. Salting it and setting it aside for 15 to 30 minutes before cooking helps combat both of these issues. The salt makes the eggplant \u201csweat out\u201d (literally) the excess moisture and bitter flavor. However, if you use Japanese eggplants (the long and skinny ones), you can skip the salting step.\nTo Peel or Not To Peel\nOne of the pain points of cooking eggplant is deciding whether or not to peel it. The short answer: leave the skin on. The longer answer: it depends. If your eggplants are small, their skin is probably tender. But if they\u2019re on the larger side, while the skin remains edible, it may have a tougher texture. It also depends on the recipe. If you plan to eat it in chunks or slices, leave the skin on. But for other uses (like this eggplant \u201ccaviar\u201d), eggplants can be roasted whole, then peeled, and pureed.\nThe most important reason to leave the skin on is to preserve nutrients. Like with many fruits and vegetables, most of eggplant\u2019s nutritional value is in its skin. Aside from being high in fiber (like all plants), eggplants have antimutagenic [anti-cancer], antimicrobial, and antiviral properties.\nWatch the Video\n\nHow to Serve Soy-Glazed Eggplant\nWhat I love about this dish is that you can serve it hot, at room temperature, or cold. It\u2019s absolutely delicious in every way. Have it over fluffy rice or soba noodles for a complete meal, or serve as a side.\nMore Eggplant Recipes\n\nMini Eggplant Lasagnas\nOttolenghi-Inspired Eggplant with Tahini\nUkrainian Eggplant Caviar (\u201cIkra\u201d)\nAir Fryer Miso Eggplant\n\nLet me know if you try this recipe!

Serve hot or at room temp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n\n\nScale\n1x2x3x \n\n\n\n\n3 small eggplants (about 1 1/4 pounds), ends trimmed\nAbout 3 tablespoons neutral oil, like avocado, organic canola, or refined coconut\n1/2 medium red onion, thinly sliced* (see note below)\n2 medium garlic cloves, minced\n1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger\n1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\n1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar\n2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil\nAbout 1/4 cup crushed peanuts, for serving*\nFresh cilantro, basil, or scallions, for serving\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCook Mode\n\nPrevent your screen from going dark \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\nCut the eggplants into 2-inch chunks. Place a layer of eggplant into a colander and sprinkle liberally with salt. Continue layering and salting each layer. Set aside for 15 to 30 minutes.\nWhen the eggplant looks sweaty, transfer it to a kitchen towel and pat dry.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough oil to coat the bottom. Arrange half of the eggplant in a single layer in the skillet and cover tightly with a lid. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, then flip and brown the other side. Remove from the skillet and cook the second batch, adding more oil as needed. Remove all the eggplant and set aside.\nAdd more oil to the skillet if needed. Add the onion and cook until it\u2019s slightly softened and browned, about 2 minutes. Then add 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon minced ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and cook for 30 seconds more.\nAdd 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Add the eggplant back in and toss to coat. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with peanuts and cilantro.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nYou can sub with white onion or shallots.\nYou can sub peanuts with roasted cashews. If you\u2019re allergic to nuts, garnish with toasted sesame seeds instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition\n\nServing Size: 1/4 of the recipe\nCalories: 170\nCarbohydrates: 9.7 g\nFiber: 5.5 g\nProtein: 3.1 g\n\n\n\nKeywords: eggplant, pan fried, soy sauce, ginger, garlic\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you make this recipe?\nTag @TheNewBaguette when you share it on Instagram!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEggplant, Gatherings, Main Course, Salads + Sides\n\nJump to Recipe\n\n\nNever Miss a Recipe\nSubscribe and get my\u00a030-Minute Vegan Dinners\u00a0e-book for free!\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also love\u2026\n Air Fryer Miso EggplantLemony Cauliflower Pasta with Fried Breadcrumbs Ukrainian Eggplant Caviar (\"Ikra\") Ottolenghi-Inspired Eggplant with Tahini and Almonds\nReader InteractionsComments\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous says \nNovember 15, 2023 at 4:37 pm \n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmily says \nAugust 28, 2022 at 9:48 pm \n\nI made this and it was perfect!
