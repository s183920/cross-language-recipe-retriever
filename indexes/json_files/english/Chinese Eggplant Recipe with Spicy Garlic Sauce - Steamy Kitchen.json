Plus, the eggplant pieces are so tender, they almost melt in your mouth.\n\nWhy This Chinese Eggplant Recipe Is So Good\n\nAn\u00a0 authentic Chinese eggplant recipe, inspired by one of the most respected authorities of Chinese cooking, Fuchsia Dunlop.\nYou can use either Japanese or Chinese eggplant even Italian globe eggplant.\nA unique Chinese sauce that\u2019s savory, sweet and piquant, called \u201cFish-Fragrant\u201d even though there\u2019s no fish in the ingredients!\n\nIngredients\u00a0\n\nCooking oil\nEggplants\nRed chile\nGinger, garlic\nOnions\nSoy sauce\nChinese black vinegar\nSugar\n\nHow To Make This Chinese Eggplant Recipe\n\n\nIn a wok or saucepan over high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil and swirl to coat wok. When wok is hot, add eggplant in a single layer. Cook 2 minutes and flip over each piece so they cook evenly. Cook another 2-3 minutes, flipping occasionally.The egg plant should have changed in color, the skin wrinkled and the flesh soft.\n\n\nPush eggplant aside in wok and add 1 tablespoon cooking oil. Add garlic, red chile peppers, ginger and green onion. Stir these aromatics until they become fragrant. Combine aromatics with eggplant and stir fry for one minute. Add soy sauce, black vinegar and sugar and stir to combine all. Serve immediately.\n\n\n\nWhat Type Of Eggplant Should I Use?\nWe grow both Chinese and Japanese eggplant in the garden, both of which are less-bitter than the standard fat Globe variety. I\u2019ve heard cooks needing to \u201csalt\u201d the eggplant and let it sit to release its bitter compounds. Not needed for the Asian variety!\nBut either variety is perfect for this Chinese Eggplant recipe.\nThe skin of Japanese and Chinese eggplant is much thinner as well.\nWhile this is a Chinese Eggplant recipe, I used Japanese eggplant variety (my Chinese plant was towards the end of its life cycle and was only poppin\u2019 out eggplant runts).\nOther than just simple roasting, this is really the only other way I cook eggplant often \u2013 it\u2019s a wonderful flavor party \u2013 chiles, garlic, soy sauce and a touch of black vinegar to balance the flavors out.\nA Delicious Sauce\nThe translated Chinese name for this dish is \u201cFish-Fragrant Eggplant\u201d which is so unfortunate. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s deterred many cooks from even trying the recipe. The reason it\u2019s called this is because the dish originates from Sichuan province of China.\nSichuanese cooking has so many different descriptors for its 56 distinct cooking methods and 23 \u201cofficial\u201d Sichuanese flavoring combinations. The \u201cFish-Flavored\u201d refers to the combination: salty+sweet+sour+spicy+garlic+ginger+green onion. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 the sauce doesn\u2019t taste fishy, nor the does the recipe contain any fish at all. \u00a0It\u2019s a sauce that goes GREAT with many Sichuan fish dishes \u2013 thus the funny translated name.\nMaking This Chinese Eggplant Recipe Paleo Friendly\nIf you\u2019re on a paleo diet, substitute the soy sauce with Liquid Aminos or Coconut Aminos. There\u2019s only 1/2 teaspoon of sugar in the recipe, and you can omit that, or substitute with sweetener of your choice. I prefer a little bit of sweetener, to counter the acidity of the black vinegar.\u00a0\n\nTop Tips\n\nIf you can find Chinese bean paste \u2013 add 1 tablespoon to the stir-fry and cut the soy sauce to just 1 teaspoon.\nThe original Chinese Eggplant recipe \u00a0uses Chinese Black Vinegar \u2013 which is very similar to young balsamic vinegar. You can use either. The balsamic vinegar should be tart, not sweet \u2013 so don\u2019t use the expensive super-aged super-thick sweet stuff (save that for your strawberries).\nIf you can\u2019t find Chinese or Japanese eggplants, just use globe eggplant! Cut in similar sized strips. Baby globe eggplant is really good too. No need to salt. Just rinse, cut into thin wedges.\nWhen cooked, the eggplant should have changed color, skin wrinkled and flesh soft.\n\nVideo: Chinese Eggplant Recipe with Spicy Garlic Sauce\n\n\nCheck Out Other Chinese Vegetable Recipes\n\nChinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce Recipe\nChinese Baby Bok Choy Recipe\nChinese Leafy Greens (Yu Choy) Recipe\n\nHave you tried this Chinese Eggplant recipe?

To help with the excessive oil, I actually used cooking spray and a splash of water to each batch. I also subbed a Serrano pepper since I didn\u2019t have a red chili.

Scoop out the inner part, or cut through the skin and inside with a knife and fork?\nIs it possible to cook this by slicing the eggplants first, or would it get too soft?\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaiza \non 9/28/20 at 9:39 pm \n\n\n\n\nI normally do not write reviews of recipes I find on the internet, but I made this today and omg it was RESTAURANT QUALITY! My husband had two bowls of this eggplant with quinoa b/c it was that good! I made slight modifications because of what I had on hand: used just 1 big globe eggplant, saut\u00e9ed the eggplant in sesame oil (gave it a really nice flavor), rice vinegar instead of black vinegar, and omitted the sugar. Delicious! Thank you for this recipe!\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Harper \non 9/26/20 at 8:20 pm \n\n\n\nWay slow, too slow to bother with again?\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnne \non 8/4/20 at 10:32 pm \n\n\n\n\nI made the recipe using 2 Chinese eggplants that were about 10 to 12\u2033 long and had too much eggplant to the amount of sauce the recipe made. It tasted delicious but really needed a lot more sauce to coat all the pieces. It would be helpful if you could give a weight quantity so that we can adjust making more sauce if our eggplant is plentiful.\nWe enjoyed it very much and I look forward to making it in correct proportions.\nThanks!\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJasmine \non 5/24/20 at 1:30 pm \n\n\n\nLove this recipe.

For one thing, eggplants takes a lot longer than five minutes to cook \u2013 if they are not soft, their flavor is not completely brought out. For another, a wok is not big enough to lay out all eggplant pieces \u2013 unless the two eggplants are awfully small. \nBut I did follow the general instructions, and the outcome was a very pretty and tasty dish. I sliced eggplants in the past, and I must say slices are not as pretty as long strips. \n I steamed eggplants before. My conclusion is, sauteed eggplants taste much better than steamed ones. It\u2019s a shame to waste eggplants by steaming. I rather run five miles. I want my eggplants sauteed.\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaden \non 2/8/17 at 11:30 am \n\n\n\n\u2026and with lots of garlic!\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKat King \non 4/10/17 at 6:21 pm \n\n\n\nDid you use Chinese long eggplant??\u2026those cook faster than large bulbous eggplant, that we commonly have in American grocery stores!!\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaden \non 4/11/17 at 9:57 am \n\n\n\nYes!

I threw in what I had in the fridge, lots of substitutions and I maybe made it more Mexican, lol. I definitely needed to cut my eggplant thinner.

I just jumped on the old \u2018net to look for recipes for Chinese eggplant since my Ping Tung plant is popping them out like crazy now, and landed right on this one \ud83d\ude42 It looks so beautiful too \u2014 can\u2019t wait to try it! I have lots of chiles/peppers but no spring onions now, so will substitute chives. Your garlic-ginger-saute\u2019d bok choi recipe instantly became my favourite way to prepare that vegetable when I first found it a couple years ago. Thank you!\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusan R \non 7/9/14 at 10:37 pm \n\n\n\nRunning out for black vinegar never heard of it but i m sure the chinese grocery store will carry it.

I made this eggplant dish last night. It was my first time cooking with black vinegar and black bean paste. The dish turned out beautifully. We thoroughly enjoyed it. Thanks for the great recipe and post. I look forward to trying more of your recipes. I will check out your quilting site too since I quilt also.

This dish is just what I have been searching for and I am in love with the recipe and the results.\nSo soft and tender the only problem: I can\u2019t stop eating it and then there is none for the family\u2026..\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlicia \non 5/2/14 at 9:37 pm \n\n\n\nFor those people enquiring about the bitterness or otherwise of eggplant (aubergine, in Europe). Fresh eggplant of any variety should not be bitter, particularly modern strains that we will buy in the shops. If your eggplant is old, then it will be bitter, that\u2019s why someone said they found a bitter one once. To choose a fresh eggplant, always look for the \u201cleaves\u201d where the stem joins the plant. This green bit should be green, not brown, not greyish and not bruised. The eggplant should look plump, not shrivelled, and the freshest eggplants will look shiny and bursting with life. There shouldn\u2019t be discoloured spots.\nFinally, to figure out if you need to salt your eggplants (frankly, in my opinion, if they need salting I\u2019m going to bin it anyway as it\u2019s not fresh), cut a little sliver and eat it raw. If it\u2019s bitter you will taste it immediately. If it\u2019s fresh it will taste sweet and fresh.\nOh, and the dark vinegar required for this recipe is Xinjiang or Chinkiang vinegar, in case you can find it. It has a distinct flavour.\nGood luck!\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeera bali \non 5/2/14 at 12:28 pm \n\n\n\nThis is one of my favorite dishes and it tastes amazing, I have never made it at home but will try now with this recipe. I had it for the first time at a restaurant in San Jose California called Lock chun. Wow!!! Last I had it at a Chinese restaurant in Atlanta Georgia, I believe if I can get the sauce right I can make it at home. I won\u2019t eat most eggplant dishes, this one I can eat without rice or anything. I m Indian and we eat loads of eggplant in different preparations, this Chinese one is amazing\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeanine \non 4/7/14 at 9:48 pm \n\n\n\nI did a random search on the internet for Chinese eggplant recipes, found yours, fixed it, and OOOOH!

Yuu xiang chie zi is one of my favorite dishes (although I\u2019ve never made it at home. Now I have to.) Typically, I find they don\u2019t need salting, but I had a bad experience once with some eggplants that turned out very bitter. Since then, I always salt, but now I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m paranoid\u2026\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeth B \non 2/18/14 at 8:52 pm \n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t grow up eating eggplant (and lots of other delicious veggies) and am so happy to find this recipe.

It\u2019s interesting to read about the bitterness of globe eggplants..can they really be bitter in America? I buy regular globe eggplants all the time here in Switzerland and never had a single one that was bitter. Could it be because they let them grow to big in the States? (I was always amazed at the huge sizes of some veggies and fruits over there!). Anyway I need to make this dish soon again, it tastes as delicious as it looks!\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom mclaughlin \non 2/18/14 at 12:59 am \n\n\n\nYu Shang chetzu is one of my favorite Chinese dishes. I tried the recipe and found that the eggplants do not get soft as in a restaurant. So I asked the chef. He said he deep fries the eggplant.\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBella \non 3/6/15 at 8:16 pm \n\n\n\nInstead of deep frying, you can steam the eggplants separately first to your desired level of softness. Much healthier and is really quick and effective.Then add to stirfryed ingredients\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntamsyn \non 12/2/15 at 2:57 am \n\n\n\nI fry the eggplants with a half cup water added and then put a lid on for my Thai style basil/eggplant.
