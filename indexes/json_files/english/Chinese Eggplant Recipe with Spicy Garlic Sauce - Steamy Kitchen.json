Plus, the eggplant pieces are so tender, they almost melt in your mouth.  Why This Chinese Eggplant Recipe Is So Good  An\u00a0 authentic Chinese eggplant recipe, inspired by one of the most respected authorities of Chinese cooking, Fuchsia Dunlop. You can use either Japanese or Chinese eggplant even Italian globe eggplant. A unique Chinese sauce that\u2019s savory, sweet and piquant, called \u201cFish-Fragrant\u201d even though there\u2019s no fish in the ingredients!  Ingredients\u00a0  Cooking oil Eggplants Red chile Ginger, garlic Onions Soy sauce Chinese black vinegar Sugar  How To Make This Chinese Eggplant Recipe   In a wok or saucepan over high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil and swirl to coat wok. When wok is hot, add eggplant in a single layer. Cook 2 minutes and flip over each piece so they cook evenly. Cook another 2-3 minutes, flipping occasionally.The egg plant should have changed in color, the skin wrinkled and the flesh soft.   Push eggplant aside in wok and add 1 tablespoon cooking oil. Add garlic, red chile peppers, ginger and green onion. Stir these aromatics until they become fragrant. Combine aromatics with eggplant and stir fry for one minute. Add soy sauce, black vinegar and sugar and stir to combine all. Serve immediately.    What Type Of Eggplant Should I Use? We grow both Chinese and Japanese eggplant in the garden, both of which are less-bitter than the standard fat Globe variety. I\u2019ve heard cooks needing to \u201csalt\u201d the eggplant and let it sit to release its bitter compounds. Not needed for the Asian variety! But either variety is perfect for this Chinese Eggplant recipe. The skin of Japanese and Chinese eggplant is much thinner as well. While this is a Chinese Eggplant recipe, I used Japanese eggplant variety (my Chinese plant was towards the end of its life cycle and was only poppin\u2019 out eggplant runts). Other than just simple roasting, this is really the only other way I cook eggplant often \u2013 it\u2019s a wonderful flavor party \u2013 chiles, garlic, soy sauce and a touch of black vinegar to balance the flavors out. A Delicious Sauce The translated Chinese name for this dish is \u201cFish-Fragrant Eggplant\u201d which is so unfortunate. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s deterred many cooks from even trying the recipe. The reason it\u2019s called this is because the dish originates from Sichuan province of China. Sichuanese cooking has so many different descriptors for its 56 distinct cooking methods and 23 \u201cofficial\u201d Sichuanese flavoring combinations. The \u201cFish-Flavored\u201d refers to the combination: salty+sweet+sour+spicy+garlic+ginger+green onion. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 the sauce doesn\u2019t taste fishy, nor the does the recipe contain any fish at all. \u00a0It\u2019s a sauce that goes GREAT with many Sichuan fish dishes \u2013 thus the funny translated name. Making This Chinese Eggplant Recipe Paleo Friendly If you\u2019re on a paleo diet, substitute the soy sauce with Liquid Aminos or Coconut Aminos. There\u2019s only 1/2 teaspoon of sugar in the recipe, and you can omit that, or substitute with sweetener of your choice. I prefer a little bit of sweetener, to counter the acidity of the black vinegar.\u00a0  Top Tips  If you can find Chinese bean paste \u2013 add 1 tablespoon to the stir-fry and cut the soy sauce to just 1 teaspoon. The original Chinese Eggplant recipe \u00a0uses Chinese Black Vinegar \u2013 which is very similar to young balsamic vinegar. You can use either. The balsamic vinegar should be tart, not sweet \u2013 so don\u2019t use the expensive super-aged super-thick sweet stuff (save that for your strawberries). If you can\u2019t find Chinese or Japanese eggplants, just use globe eggplant! Cut in similar sized strips. Baby globe eggplant is really good too. No need to salt. Just rinse, cut into thin wedges. When cooked, the eggplant should have changed color, skin wrinkled and flesh soft.

To help with the excessive oil, I actually used cooking spray and a splash of water to each batch. I also subbed a Serrano pepper since I didn\u2019t have a red chili. Really good recipe! Reply          Monica Hamm  on 2/8/23 at 7:44 pm     Amazon sells organic Chinese black vinegar\u2026\u2026. totally worth it to have on hand in the vinegar section of my pantry! Reply          Joe  on 2/4/23 at 2:12 am      This was delicious, but I had to use way more oil than called for. Part of the issue was that I had to cook the eggplant in batches, in order to cook it in a single layer. I served it with crispy tofu to turn it into a main course. Reply          Wynne  on 1/30/23 at 2:26 pm     Where did you get your wok? I have an electric stove and not sure what would work best.

Reply          M Shannon Peterson  on 8/30/22 at 9:06 am      We made this with soy scarce and onion with steak ! Absolutely delicious Reply            Efrat  on 7/9/22 at 3:42 pm      I love this recipe though I made it a little bit less spicy. My family loves it, it\u2019s very easy to make and delicious. I replaced black vinegar with rice vinegar and it was just fine. Reply          Irena  on 7/3/22 at 9:02 pm      Fantastic! I picked my Japanese eggplants a few minutes before doing this recipe. Exquisite! Even a friend who doesn\u2019t like eggplant went wild over it! Reply          Tina  on 9/15/21 at 6:06 pm      I\u2019ve made this before and wanted to try again with addition of some protein. I was thinking either beef or pork. Can I increase the amount of sauce and just add the protein? Or should the protein be flavored with other ingredients? Has anyone tried adding any meat? Lmk. Reply          Diane  on 5/26/21 at 2:11 pm     How do you eat these eggplants? Scoop out the inner part, or cut through the skin and inside with a knife and fork? Is it possible to cook this by slicing the eggplants first, or would it get too soft? Reply          Faiza  on 9/28/20 at 9:39 pm      I normally do not write reviews of recipes I find on the internet, but I made this today and omg it was RESTAURANT QUALITY! My husband had two bowls of this eggplant with quinoa b/c it was that good! I made slight modifications because of what I had on hand: used just 1 big globe eggplant, saut\u00e9ed the eggplant in sesame oil (gave it a really nice flavor), rice vinegar instead of black vinegar, and omitted the sugar. Delicious! Thank you for this recipe! Reply          William Harper  on 9/26/20 at 8:20 pm     Way slow, too slow to bother with again? Reply          Anne  on 8/4/20 at 10:32 pm      I made the recipe using 2 Chinese eggplants that were about 10 to 12\u2033 long and had too much eggplant to the amount of sauce the recipe made. It tasted delicious but really needed a lot more sauce to coat all the pieces. It would be helpful if you could give a weight quantity so that we can adjust making more sauce if our eggplant is plentiful. We enjoyed it very much and I look forward to making it in correct proportions. Thanks! Reply          Jasmine  on 5/24/20 at 1:30 pm     Love this recipe. Simple yet delightful to the palate! Made this twice over isolation and my family enjoyed it! Thank you for sharing!! Reply          Phillip Minyard  on 5/23/20 at 1:37 pm     How much is 1/2 inch fresh ginger? The best measure is by weight. The second best is by volume, such as 1 teaspoon, etc. Is 1/2 inch a 1/2 inch piece of 1/2 inch diameter, 1 inch diameter, etc.? Reply          Ke  on 7/7/20 at 12:41 am     Fresh ginger is like a finger. So measure about a half inch of your finger or the ginger. Reply            Claudia  on 5/6/20 at 8:19 pm     Truly delicious! I have done it twice and each time it was a hit. Easy to prepare and super tasty! Thank you so much for sharing!

I dont like my dishes too sweet lol Reply          Teddy Baker  on 7/12/19 at 3:19 pm      Great recipe. The comments on the globe eggplant, though, are old wives tales. Modern globe eggplant are not bitter and never need salting. Just an old chef\u2019s habit which needs to be disabused and discarded.

Reply          Rose  on 4/4/17 at 8:16 pm     This was so good! I modified it a little \u2013 cutting the eggplant into cubes, microwaving for 6 minutes to speed up the cooking process, and adding Lao Gan Ma spicy chili crisp instead of chili pepper.

Thank you! \ud83d\ude42 Reply          Jaden  on 3/27/17 at 6:48 pm     Hi Lily! Absolutely \ud83d\ude42 Reply            janice  on 2/8/17 at 3:32 am     The instructions do not work completely. For one thing, eggplants takes a lot longer than five minutes to cook \u2013 if they are not soft, their flavor is not completely brought out. For another, a wok is not big enough to lay out all eggplant pieces \u2013 unless the two eggplants are awfully small.  But I did follow the general instructions, and the outcome was a very pretty and tasty dish. I sliced eggplants in the past, and I must say slices are not as pretty as long strips.   I steamed eggplants before. My conclusion is, sauteed eggplants taste much better than steamed ones. It\u2019s a shame to waste eggplants by steaming. I rather run five miles. I want my eggplants sauteed. Reply          Jaden  on 2/8/17 at 11:30 am     \u2026and with lots of garlic!

Reply          Jaden  on 4/11/17 at 9:57 am     Yes! I use both Chinese and Japanese eggplant. I love those both better than round Italian style globe eggplant. Reply              Cleone  on 8/10/16 at 2:23 am     Great recipe! I omitted the chili and used balsamic vinegar instead of black vinegar. Still tasted great!

Reply          Natalie Luffer  on 5/8/14 at 11:36 am     Wow Jaden, quite a while since I saw a post. This dish is just what I have been searching for and I am in love with the recipe and the results. So soft and tender the only problem: I can\u2019t stop eating it and then there is none for the family\u2026.. Reply          Alicia  on 5/2/14 at 9:37 pm     For those people enquiring about the bitterness or otherwise of eggplant (aubergine, in Europe). Fresh eggplant of any variety should not be bitter, particularly modern strains that we will buy in the shops. If your eggplant is old, then it will be bitter, that\u2019s why someone said they found a bitter one once. To choose a fresh eggplant, always look for the \u201cleaves\u201d where the stem joins the plant. This green bit should be green, not brown, not greyish and not bruised. The eggplant should look plump, not shrivelled, and the freshest eggplants will look shiny and bursting with life. There shouldn\u2019t be discoloured spots. Finally, to figure out if you need to salt your eggplants (frankly, in my opinion, if they need salting I\u2019m going to bin it anyway as it\u2019s not fresh), cut a little sliver and eat it raw. If it\u2019s bitter you will taste it immediately. If it\u2019s fresh it will taste sweet and fresh. Oh, and the dark vinegar required for this recipe is Xinjiang or Chinkiang vinegar, in case you can find it. It has a distinct flavour. Good luck! Reply          meera bali  on 5/2/14 at 12:28 pm     This is one of my favorite dishes and it tastes amazing, I have never made it at home but will try now with this recipe. I had it for the first time at a restaurant in San Jose California called Lock chun. Wow!!! Last I had it at a Chinese restaurant in Atlanta Georgia, I believe if I can get the sauce right I can make it at home. I won\u2019t eat most eggplant dishes, this one I can eat without rice or anything. I m Indian and we eat loads of eggplant in different preparations, this Chinese one is amazing Reply          Jeanine  on 4/7/14 at 9:48 pm     I did a random search on the internet for Chinese eggplant recipes, found yours, fixed it, and OOOOH! YUMMY! Thank you so much. I did have bean paste I had luckily bought on a whim the week before! Yay! Easy, delicious, and fast. I made mine over rice and it was a great simple dinner. Thank you again! Reply          Vi  on 3/26/14 at 1:19 am     I just made this and it turned out fantastic! Love your tasty, easy, fast recipes. So glad I found your blog!

Simply delicious and supper easy to prepare. Reply          Laura @ Laura's Culinary Adventures  on 2/24/14 at 10:58 am     Yum! Chinese eggplant is one of my favorite vegetables! I have most of these ingredients already on hand. Thanks for sharing! Reply          Jenny  on 2/23/14 at 10:22 pm     This was delicious! Thank you for sharing!! Reply          Jeanne K  on 2/21/14 at 5:25 pm     Ooh, one of my favorite dishes (and one my teenage daughter loves, too)! I usually use brown sugar and a splash of oyster sauce in my version (the remaining ingredients are the same, though). I can\u2019t wait to try your recipe\u2013it looks delicious. Reply          Shashi @ RunninSrilankan  on 2/21/14 at 12:00 pm     This eggplant sounds fantastic \u2013 love the color and flavor the red pepper and green chili give it! Reply          Miche  on 2/20/14 at 2:48 pm     I love cooking with Chinese and Japanese eggplants! Yuu xiang chie zi is one of my favorite dishes (although I\u2019ve never made it at home. Now I have to.) Typically, I find they don\u2019t need salting, but I had a bad experience once with some eggplants that turned out very bitter. Since then, I always salt, but now I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m paranoid\u2026 Reply          Beth B  on 2/18/14 at 8:52 pm     I didn\u2019t grow up eating eggplant (and lots of other delicious veggies) and am so happy to find this recipe. Sounds delicious. Also, the video is so very helpful. Lastly, I love that you include a picture in the printed recipe. It reminds me why I printed a recipe when I see the photo. Reply          Caroline  on 2/18/14 at 1:36 am     Hm I love this dish! Eggplants are one of my favorite vegetables! It\u2019s interesting to read about the bitterness of globe eggplants..can they really be bitter in America? I buy regular globe eggplants all the time here in Switzerland and never had a single one that was bitter. Could it be because they let them grow to big in the States? (I was always amazed at the huge sizes of some veggies and fruits over there!). Anyway I need to make this dish soon again, it tastes as delicious as it looks! Reply          Tom mclaughlin  on 2/18/14 at 12:59 am     Yu Shang chetzu is one of my favorite Chinese dishes. I tried the recipe and found that the eggplants do not get soft as in a restaurant. So I asked the chef. He said he deep fries the eggplant. Reply          Bella  on 3/6/15 at 8:16 pm     Instead of deep frying, you can steam the eggplants separately first to your desired level of softness. Much healthier and is really quick and effective.Then add to stirfryed ingredients Reply          tamsyn  on 12/2/15 at 2:57 am     I fry the eggplants with a half cup water added and then put a lid on for my Thai style basil/eggplant. Stops eggplants soaking up too much oil as they\u2019re basically being braised. Reply              Cooking Jar and Happy Accidents  on 2/17/14 at 6:13 pm     Looks like a simple, easy stir-fry that yields just enough yum. I do envy the clicks, it\u2019s not often eggplant in cooked form can look this good. Reply          Ramya Raj  on 2/17/14 at 4:55 pm     Looks absolutely delicious! Nothing beats the taste of freshly picked eggplant, savored as fish by vegetarians in India.
