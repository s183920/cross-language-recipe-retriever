Some modifications: added several cloves of garlic to the onion, then a couple of shredded carrots to the onion/ garlic mixture, I did not drain the beef before putting in crockpot and used only one 8 oz can of tomato paste. Also, fresh chopped parsley on top might be add more flavor. I didn't have one on hand, so made some simple arugula salad on the side (lemon-oil-Parm).\n    \n\n    \n    \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                yulia.trevor\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n              Reply\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Delicious sauce, will become my standard recipe! I tripled the recipe to put some away in the freezer for future use, and the only alteration I did was add a head of garlic...couldn't quite believe garlic wasn't already called for, but it's not quite Italian if there's not garlic in it.  I rate the recipe as written, but this was 5 stars when I was done.  People were eating it with no noodles by the end of the night lol.\n    \n\n    \n    \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                jessiethebestie\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n              Reply\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Yummy sauce! I made the stovetop version and loved the aroma while it was cooking. Very simple and good. Thanks Boomette for a nice treat.

I used my home made tomato sauce and simmered for 2 hours. The smell forced me to test taste this sauce every 15 min. or so. YUM! It makes quite a bit so I'll  freeze some for later.

The addition of the beef broth gives the sauce such a rich flavor. I must admit I made 2 small changes to the recipe though. First off I used 1/2 of the beef and added Italian sausage to the mix. The other thing I did was to cut the tomato paste back and I added a bit extra tomato sauce. That was done because a sensitivity issue with one of my kids. Though she can eat things with tomato sauce and diced cooked tomatoes, things with high amounts of tomato paste cause her oral allergy to kick in...probably because it is so concentrated. This is a real keeper Boomette! Thanks for sharing.
