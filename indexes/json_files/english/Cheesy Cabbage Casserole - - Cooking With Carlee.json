Make that side out of cabbage for a fun twist on the cheesy potato casserole we all love!  Jump to Recipe\n\n\n\nCheesy cabbage casserole is a lot like cheesy potatoes, or funeral potatoes as you may know them, but without the potatoes. This is a lower carb alternative if you are looking for that or just a fun way to use up that cabbage. It is cheesy, comforting and oh so good.\nWe have been getting beautiful heads of cabbage in our CSA boxes.\u00a0 This was a particularly huge and nice head of cabbage.\u00a0 My husband is not a fan of cooked cabbage in general and he also doesn\u2019t eat coleslaw.\n\n\nWhile I like both, this huge head of cabbage was more than I thought I could tackle on my own.\u00a0 Even I have my limits after all!\nSo I decided to go on a mission and get creative in hopes that my husband and Little Dude would help me eat the cabbage before I had to leave town for work.\u00a0 I had seen a recipe title for cabbage casserole somewhere and that got my wheels turning.\n\n\nI enjoy cabbage with Parmesan cheese on it, but that was the extent of my cabbage and cheese mingling experience. The idea of a cheesy cabbage seemed a little strange but also felt like it had potential.\nWe are all big fans of cheese, so I thought if anything would get the guys to help me on this quest adding plenty of cheese would!\u00a0 So I went to work making a cabbage version of the cheesy potato casserole.\n\n\nMaking Cabbage Casserole\nOne of the keys to making this cabbage casserole easy to eat and palatable for even the cabbage wary is to finely chop the cabbage. It will cook more evenly and eat more like a potato casserole that way.\nThinly slice it and then run your knife through it again the other way.\u00a0 That way you get nice tidy bites of cheesy cabbage goodness.\n\n\nYou could certainly mix it all together in a bowl before putting it in a casserole dish.\u00a0 I chose to dirty one less bowl and just layer it in the baking pan.\u00a0 \nCabbage cooks down so much and releases some liquid, so it all kind of comes together in the end either way.\n\n\nWhen you pour the cheese and soup over the cabbage, it may look like it\u2019s not enough. But the cabbage will cook down so it will magically be just the perfect amount.\nMy husband served himself up a big serving for dinner.\u00a0 I guess he didn\u2019t see any of the assembly and thought he was sitting down to a nice pile of cheesy potatoes.\u00a0 \n\n\nA bite or two in he realized that\u2019s not exactly what he had and recognized I tricked him into cabbage.\nHe went ahead and ate it anyway even with the knowledge of it\u2019s true identity. Honestly he didn\u2019t race me to eat the leftovers, but that was fine. I really liked it and ate it for lunch most of the rest of the week.\n\n\nI think you should definitely give this recipe a go! Maybe you can convert a cabbage hater into a lover or maybe you will find a new favorite side dish.\nWe have been still been getting great cabbage, both green and red. What are your favorite ways to eat cabbage?\n\n\n\nWhat does cheesy cabbage casserole taste like?\n\nThis casserole tastes a lot like funeral potatoes, but with cabbage instead of potatoes. So it has more fiber and is a great way to make cabbage family friendly.\n\n\n\nCan I add meat to this to make it a complete meal?\n\nYes! Some diced ham would be great or even some kielbasa. You could also add browned ground beef or turkey if you want.\n\n\n\n\nMore Cabbage Recipes\n\nCabbage and Potatoes with Parmesan Cheese\n\nThis simple side dish of cabbage and potatoes with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese has been a favorite in my family for decades.\n\nGet the Recipe\n\n\n\nCabbage Roll Skillet Meal\n\nGet the flavor of cabbage rolls without the work!

One of your comments said you had 13 cups of cabbage. Do you know how much it weighed? A large head of cabbage isn\u2019t a good measure because you don\u2019t know how much it makes. Also, the density of the cabbage varies so a dense medium sized cabbage could be all that is needed. The weight of a head of cabbage would be useful so it could be weighed in the produce section of grocery stores that have scales before buying it. \nThx! I\u2019m excited to try it.\n\n\n\n\nCarlee\nWednesday 24th of November 2021\n\n\n\nThe recipe is pretty forgiving, so I wouldn't let an exact weight stop you. But I will try to remember to weigh the cabbage next time I make it. Thanks for the suggestion \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmommar6\nMonday 20th of July 2020\n\n\n\nWhat a fun way to give a boring vegetable a new life!
