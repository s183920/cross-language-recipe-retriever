I have since had it many times and it seems a standard in restaurants serving South East Asian or Chinese food. In fact, it seems to be a dish that is standard fare in the better restaurants that serve Indian Chinese or Indo-Chinese food.\nI\u2019ve never been a fan of spinach by and large. I\u2019m fine with tender spinach in salads or in this dish where it is cooked with lentils and coconut. \u00a0I like Palak Paneer too but that\u2019s a s far as it goes. Now, I\u2019ve added Crackling Spinach to the list.\n\n\n\nSo what is Crackling Spinach? In India, this an Indian Chinese dish of crisp fried spinach ribbons. Topped with red chilli flakes and sesame seeds, it is salty with a hint of sweet and pleasantly crunchy.\nLike many other popular Indian Chinese dishes, this one is an Indian take on something that used to be Chinese in origin. Apparently, in North Eastern China, this is a dish made with a particular kind of seaweed not available elsewhere. It turns out that in the UK, Chinese restaurants serve something called Crispy Seaweed. This is quite like the Indian Crackling Spinach except it\u2019s not made with seaweed at all. There they use shredded Savoy cabbage, Bok Choi (Pak Choy), collard greens, or even kale.\n\n \n\nThis recipe has been partially adapted from the Mainland China\u2019s cookbook. Crackling Spinach is usually found in the starter section of menus in Indian Chinese restaurants but it may also be served on the side as part of the main meal.\n\nI\u2019m also taking this opportunity to announce the winner of my giveaway of Jamie Schler\u2019s cookbook Orange Appeal. You might remember that Gibbs-Smith, the publishers of Jamie\u2019s cookbook were very generous and offered a copy of the book to a lucky winner, to be shipped worldwide.\nWell Manisha of Indian Food Rocks, congratulations to you! You just won that copy of Orange Appeal. Keep a lookout for an email from me and you can look forward to your book some time soon. \n\n\nCrackling Spinach\n\n\nAn Indian Chinese starter or side dish of crisp fried spinach ribbons seasoned with salt, sugar, red chilli flakes and toasted sesame seeds.\n\n\n\n Print Recipe\n Pin Recipe\n\n\n \nPrep Time 25 minutes minsCook Time 20 minutes minsTotal Time 45 minutes mins\n\n\n\n \nCourse Side DishCuisine indianchinese\n\n\n \nServings 4 servings\n\n\nIngredients\u00a0\u00a045-50 spinach leaves2 tbsp corn-starchOil for deep frying1 tsp powdered sugarsalt to taste1 tbsp chili flakes1 tbsp roasted sesame seeds\nInstructions\u00a0Wash the spinach leaves and pat them dry. If the leaves are damp, it will clump together when corn-starch is added and your Crackling Spinach will be greasy. Take 8 to 10 leaves at a time and lay one over the other, roll and chop into fine strips/ ribbons. Do this with all the leaves. Separate the spinach strips/ ribbons with your fingers. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the spinach\u00a0 and then toss well so the spinach is evenly and well coated. Make sure the spinach is well separated and not clumped together. Heat the oil in a wok. Fry the spinach in about 4 or 5 batches. When it about smoking hot, drop the coated spinach and fry till crisp but not brown. This should not take more than 2 or 3 minutes.Drain on paper towels. While still hot, sprinkle \u00a0red chilli flakes, salt, powdered sugar and toasted sesame seeds. Toss lightly to mix well. Serve immediately.\n\n \n\n\n       374shares\nFiled Under: Appetizers & Tea-time Snacks Tagged With: Easy Recipes, Gluten-free, VeganPrevious Post: \u00ab Easy 2 Ingredient Oreo BatsNext Post: Tamarillo and Pear Jam \u00bbReader InteractionsComments\n\n\n\n\nTanna says \nNovember 4, 2017 at 10:20 pm \n\nOh my heart is pounding!  I on the other hand from you, LOVE spinach. I buy it in the biggest container I can find and put it in just about anything \u2013 oatmeal, yes; ice cream, no.\nBut this, this recipe and photos really excites me. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. This is in my top five to cook!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAparna Balasubramanian says \nNovember 6, 2017 at 7:45 pm \n\nI\u2019m afraid I really do not like spinach that much. I would have been stunned if you put it in ice-cream though. \ud83d\ude00\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimi Anwar says \nNovember 5, 2017 at 9:18 am \n\nInteresting.

I have never come across crackling spinach before, so it\u2019s something very new to me. My husband loves spinach, so he would enjoy this starter a lot!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeena Shah says \nJune 9, 2020 at 2:04 am \n\nI had Crackling Spinach a few years back in a Top Burmese Restaurant in my town. And man! I loved it..\nAlways wondered how the flavours were so perfectly blended. This recipe puts those questions to rest.
