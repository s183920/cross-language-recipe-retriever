Add in the shallot and lower the heat. Saute until for a few minutes. Stir in the garlic for 30 seconds then add in the cabbage on medium heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir to coat. If the cabbage looks dry, add in another drizzle of olive oil. Cook until they soften, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Remove the cabbage to a large bowl and allow it to cool off slightly. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F. Spray an 8\u00d78 inch square baking dish with olive oil. In a small bowl, mix up your panko, olive oil, onion powder, paprika and salt to taste.Add the dill, flour, pecorino, eggs, mozzarella, milk, chili flakes, salt and pepper to taste to your cabbage mixture. Mix until incorporated. Transfer to baking dish and spread out evenly pressing down gently. Sprinkle evenly with the panko and bake for about 25-30 minutes or until top is golden brown. You can broil at the end if you need to, to get the golden brown crust.\nNutritionCalories: 368kcal | Carbohydrates: 25g | Protein: 16g | Fat: 23g | Saturated Fat: 8g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 2g | Monounsaturated Fat: 12g | Trans Fat: 0.01g | Cholesterol: 112mg | Sodium: 418mg | Potassium: 365mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 7g | Vitamin A: 688IU | Vitamin C: 46mg | Calcium: 324mg | Iron: 2mg\nAuthor: Stella\n\n\n\nVegetarian\n\nPin\nShare\nTweet\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a comment Cancel reply\nRecipe Rating \nRecipe Rating\n \n\nComment * Name * \nEmail * \nSave my name and email in this browser for the next time I comment.\n \n\n\n8 comments\n\n\n\n\n\nRitaSeptember 19, 2022 \n\nI made a double batch yesterday.
