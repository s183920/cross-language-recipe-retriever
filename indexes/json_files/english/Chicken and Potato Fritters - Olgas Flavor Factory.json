They are made with chopped chicken, grated potato, minced onion and it\u2019s all mixed together in a batter. Crisp and golden on the outside, they are pretty and so delicious too. \n\n\nIn our family, chicken fritters always get a big thumbs up. I decided to add some potatoes and onion to the mix to create this new variation, Chicken and Potato Fritters. The addition of the potatoes and onion adds more flavor and texture to the fritters. \nGrating the potatoes finely allows them to cook through quickly enough while the chicken is cooking. It\u2019s an easy way to stretch your grocery budget just a bit, since adding a potato will give you more fritters. I always make a big batch so we can enjoy them for more than one dinner. They reheat really well and most of the work can be done in advance, so it\u2019s wonderful for meal prepping too. \n\nIngredients: \nchickenmost of the time, I use chicken breast, but I\u2019ve also used chicken thighs or even turkey meat for this recipe. potato (es) you can use any potatoes for this recipe, but I recommend gold potatoes. They don\u2019t oxidize as quickly as other potatoes and have just the right starch content. onion (yellow or white onion)eggsmayonnaise plain Greek yogurt or sour cream can be substitutedcornstarch this will give a lovely crunch to the fritters and will thicken the batter. Flour can be used, but it will be more gummy.salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, seasonings use any seasonings that you like for poultry. Some of my favorite are paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, dry herbs: chives, parsley, thyme, rosemary, bay leaf, etc.oil, to pan fry the fritters (avocado is my favorite, you can use light olive oil, ghee, vegetable oils)\n\n\nHow To Make Chicken and Potato Fritters\nCut the chicken into small pieces. Place it into a large mixing bowl. Peel and grate the potato on the small/medium holes of the box grater. Finely mince the onion. Make the batter. Combine the chicken with the beaten eggs, mayonnaise, cornstarch, salt, pepper and herbs and spices. Add the potatoes and onion and mix until evenly mixed. Cook the chicken fritters. Heat oil in a skillet, (enough to coat the bottom of the skillet) on medium heat. Using a big spoon, scoop and shape the meat mixture into oval or circle shapes. Cook on medium low heat, covered, 3-5 minutes on the first side, then turn over and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through on both sides.  \n\n\nCook all the batter in batches. Serve warm. Store leftovers, in an airtight container, refrigerated for 3-5 days.\n\n\nHelpful Tips \nUse any poultry for this recipe.  Most often, I use boneless skinless chicken breast for this recipe, but you can also use chicken thighs or even turkey meat. I\u2019ve even used pork shoulder.   How to make sure that the potato and onion are completely cooked through in the chicken fritters?  1. Grate/chop them very small. This is why it\u2019s extremely important to grate the potato(es) into small, thin strands and finely mince the onion. If you use the large holes of a box grater for the potato, and chop the onion into large chunks, they will still be crunchy and partially raw when then chicken cooks through.   Cook the chicken fritters covered on medium low heat.  By using lower heat and covering the skillet to trap the heat and create more steam inside, the chicken is cooked slowly and gives a chance for the potatoes and onion to cook through. If you try a fritter and realize that the potatoes and onion are not cooked through, place them into the oven, preheated to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and continue cooking until the vegetables are completely soft and tender.   Keep the chicken that you cooked in the oven while you cook the remaining chicken fritters.  This will keep the fritters warm while you\u2019re cooking the big batch of batter. This way, you can serve it to everyone at the same time and keep the first part warm.   How to Store and Reheat Chicken Fritters.  Store the chicken fritters in your refrigerator for 3-5 days in an airtight container. I haven\u2019t tried freezing cooked chicken fritters \u2013 we never have any left:). To reheat, warm up the chicken fritters in a skillet on low heat, covered, in an air fryer or oven. Of course, you can also use your  microwave.   \n\n\nPrint\n\nChicken and Potato Fritters\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrint Recipe\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n5 from 2 reviews\n\n\n\nChicken and potato fritters are made with chopped chicken, grated potato and minced onion, cooked in a batter to golden and crisp perfection.\n\n\n\nAuthor: Olga\u2019s Flavor Factory\nPrep Time: 30 minutes\nCook Time: 40 minutes\nTotal Time: 1 hour 10 minutes\nYield: 30 fritters 1x\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n\n\nScale\n1x2x3x \n\n\n\n1 1/2 lbs chicken (breast or thighs)\n1 medium potato (5\u20136 oz), peeled and grated on medium/fine holes of box grater\n1 small onion or 1/2 of a large onion, finely minced\n5 eggs, beaten\n3 Tablespoons cornstarch\n3 Tablespoons mayonnaise\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and onion powder, each\n1\u20132 teaspoons dry herbs and spices (granulated onion, granulated garlic, dry chives, dry thyme, dry parsley, paprika, etc.) If using\u00a0 dry herb mix that contains salt, reduce amount of salt in the batter.\noil, for frying (avocado, light olive oil, etc.)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCook Mode\n\n\t\t\t\tPrevent your screen from going dark\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\nChop the chicken into very small pieces.
