I haven't started baking, but I'm really excited to get back into the contests here. <br> <br><img src=http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b399/susied214/adopted_1_1.jpg border=0 alt=Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting><img src=http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b399/susied214/beartag_1_1.jpg border=0 alt=Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting>  <br><img src=http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b399/susied214/projects/200_PACpic.jpg border=0 alt=Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket> <img src=http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b399/susied214/projects/pacbanner.jpg border=0 alt=Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket> <br><img src=http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b399/susied214/permanent%20collection/Adopted1smp.jpg border=0 alt=Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket><img src=http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b399/susied214/permanent%20collection/smPACp.jpg border=0 alt=Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket> <br><img src=http://www.recipezaar.com/members/home/1535/CLC2.gif> <br> <br><img src=http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b399/susied214/permanent%20collection/PAC08Main.jpg border=0 alt=Photobucket><img src=http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b399/susied214/permanent%20collection/adoptedspring08.jpg border=0 alt=Photobucket> <br> <br>                \u00a0  View Full Profile         Advertisement      Advertisement        Advertisement      YOU'LL ALSO LOVE                           Tomato Cheesy Cabbage and Mushroom Casserole                                by                 *Parsley*            1                             How to Make Kombucha at Home                                         How to Grow a SCOBY (Kombucha Mothe...                                         34 Ham Dinner Recipes                               View All Recipes               Related Pages                                Perfect Rump Roast                                                      Broil a Perfect Steak                                                      Moist & Delicious Banana Nut Bread                                                      Simple Oven-Baked Sea Bass                                                      Mussels in White Wine and Garlic                                                      Authentic Mexican Pozole                                                      Crispy Baked Chicken Leg Quarters (Very Easy, One Dish)                                                      35 Best Pork Chop Recipes                                                      43 Favorite Potluck Recipes                                     Find More Recipes      Search         Back To Top    icons / social / facebook      icons / social / pinterest   icons / social / twitter   icons / social / youtube   icons / email                                  All Categories                                                      Site Map                                                      About Us                                                      Help                                                   The Discovery Family of Networks                        HGTV   DIY Network   Food Network   Cooking Channel   Travel Channel   HGTV Poland                         \u00a9 2023 Warner Bros.
