One year, a guest brought this cabbage dish to share and it was a big hit. She originally found the recipe in an issue of Taste of Home magazine. The chili sauce called for in this recipe is not particularly spicy (although hot versions are also sold) and is usually sold in a bottle in the ketchup aisle in US supermarkets. The brand I most often have used is Heinz.\"                \u00a0    icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal                 save          Download    Print    Share      I Made This                              photo by HeatherFeather                                Ready In: 55mins   Ingredients:                          11                        Serves:   8                          Nutrition information              Advertisement     ingredients                  Units: US     1     head    green cabbage (3 pounds)   1\u20442    cup    green bell pepper, chopped    1\u20444    cup    onion, chopped    1\u20444    cup    butter or 1/4  cup    margarine   1\u20444    cup    all-purpose flour   1\u20442    teaspoon    salt   1\u20448    teaspoon    pepper   2     cups    milk   3\u20444    cup    cheddar cheese, shredded    1\u20442    cup    mayonnaise or 1/2  cup    Miracle Whip   3     tablespoons    bottled chili sauce          Advertisement     directions   Cut cabbage into 8 wedges, leaving a bit of the core on each to help hold eachpiece together.Bring a pot of water to boil and steam cabbage wedges, covered, until crisp-tender, approximately 10-15 minutes.Drain and remove the core, then set wedges in a greased 9x13\" casserole.For the sauce, in a medium pot, saute green pepper and onion in butter until tender.Add flour, salt and pepper, stirring quickly, and cook until it gets bubbly.Add milk slowly, whisking, then cook and stir until sauce thickens.Pour over cabbage.Bake, uncovered, at 375 F for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, mix together cheese,mayo, and chili sauce; ladle over the cabbage wedges and return to oven for 5 more minutes.      icons / social / pinterest   icons / email      Questions & Replies       Sign In  to Ask a Question                Got a question?

The flavor combination created by the Miracle Whip, chili sauce and cheese was a little odd to us.                \u00a0        icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal                         Heather W.                                 Reply                                                 This was really tasty.  I made a couple modifications though that may be suggestions for others trying this out.  I don't have (nor like green bell pepper) so I used about 1/2 cup onion instead.  Also I didn't have any milk so I used a bottle of beer, and this totally made the cheese sauce work with the cabbage for me.  For the chili sauce I used garlic srirachi (it wasn't clear what the chili sauce was supposed to be) and added a couple dashes of garlic powder.  Also when I made the sauce I mixed the cheddar mayo and chili sauce into the onion/beer/butter/flour mixture after turning off the heat and then poured that over the cabbage.  The recipe as it's written looks like the onion/butter/flour/milk is supposed to be poured over the cabbage separately prior to pouring the cheese/mayo/chili sauce over the top.. Anyway it was super good and was great with the cabbage.                \u00a0        icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal                         MC Baker                                 Reply                                                 I thought this would be a nice change from the usual 'corned beef and cabbage' type cabbage, but we didn't really care for it.  The cheese sauce was good, and the cabbage was good, just maybe not together...maybe it's just me.                \u00a0        icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal                         HeatherN                                 Reply                                                 This was really good HeatherFeather. My DH is a die-hard cabbage hater, but he actually said these weren't bad.
