usually plays some part in the feast. One year, a guest brought this cabbage dish to share and it was a big hit. She originally found the recipe in an issue of Taste of Home magazine. The chili sauce called for in this recipe is not particularly spicy (although hot versions are also sold) and is usually sold in a bottle in the ketchup aisle in US supermarkets. The brand I most often have used is Heinz.\"\n    \n\n    \n    \u00a0\n\n\n\nicons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        save\n    \n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\nI Made This\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    photo by HeatherFeather\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady In:\n55mins\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n                        11\n                    \n\n\nServes:\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nutrition information\n        \n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\ningredients\n\n                Units: US\n\n\n\n\n1 \n\n  head    green cabbage (3 pounds)\n\n\n1\u20442\n\n  cup    green bell pepper, chopped \n\n\n1\u20444\n\n  cup    onion, chopped \n\n\n1\u20444\n\n  cup    butter or 1/4  cup    margarine\n\n\n1\u20444\n\n  cup    all-purpose flour\n\n\n1\u20442\n\n  teaspoon    salt\n\n\n1\u20448\n\n  teaspoon    pepper\n\n\n2 \n\n  cups    milk\n\n\n3\u20444\n\n  cup    cheddar cheese, shredded \n\n\n1\u20442\n\n  cup    mayonnaise or 1/2  cup    Miracle Whip\n\n\n3 \n\n  tablespoons    bottled chili sauce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\ndirections\n\n\nCut cabbage into 8 wedges, leaving a bit of the core on each to help hold eachpiece together.Bring a pot of water to boil and steam cabbage wedges, covered, until crisp-tender, approximately 10-15 minutes.Drain and remove the core, then set wedges in a greased 9x13\" casserole.For the sauce, in a medium pot, saute green pepper and onion in butter until tender.Add flour, salt and pepper, stirring quickly, and cook until it gets bubbly.Add milk slowly, whisking, then cook and stir until sauce thickens.Pour over cabbage.Bake, uncovered, at 375 F for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, mix together cheese,mayo, and chili sauce; ladle over the cabbage wedges and return to oven for 5 more minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nicons / social / pinterest\n\n\nicons / email\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions & Replies\n\n\n\n\n\n Sign In  to Ask a Question \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Got a question?\n      \n\n        Share it with the community!\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nMOST POPULARMOST RECENT\n\n\n\nWrite A Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Extremely rich and very good.

The flavor combination created by the Miracle Whip, chili sauce and cheese was a little odd to us.\n    \n\n    \n    \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Heather W.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n              Reply\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This was really tasty.  I made a couple modifications though that may be suggestions for others trying this out.  I don't have (nor like green bell pepper) so I used about 1/2 cup onion instead.  Also I didn't have any milk so I used a bottle of beer, and this totally made the cheese sauce work with the cabbage for me.  For the chili sauce I used garlic srirachi (it wasn't clear what the chili sauce was supposed to be) and added a couple dashes of garlic powder.  Also when I made the sauce I mixed the cheddar mayo and chili sauce into the onion/beer/butter/flour mixture after turning off the heat and then poured that over the cabbage.  The recipe as it's written looks like the onion/butter/flour/milk is supposed to be poured over the cabbage separately prior to pouring the cheese/mayo/chili sauce over the top.. Anyway it was super good and was great with the cabbage.\n    \n\n    \n    \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                MC Baker\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n              Reply\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I thought this would be a nice change from the usual 'corned beef and cabbage' type cabbage, but we didn't really care for it.  The cheese sauce was good, and the cabbage was good, just maybe not together...maybe it's just me.\n    \n\n    \n    \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                HeatherN\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n              Reply\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This was really good HeatherFeather. My DH is a die-hard cabbage hater, but he actually said these weren't bad. I did add extra sharp cheddar cheese \n    \n\n    \n    \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                lets.eat\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n              Reply\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECIPE SUBMITTED BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatherFeather\n\n\n\n\n                                USA\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\nicons / following\n\n          Follow Me\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n145\n                             Followers\n                        \n\n\n\n557\n                             Recipes\n                        \n\n\n\n28\n                             Tweaks\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nYOU'LL ALSO LOVE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Grilled Cabbage Wedges With a Creamy Onion Vinaigrette\n            \n\n\n                by\n                SarasotaCook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Roasted Cabbage Wedges\n            \n\n\n                by\n                windhorse23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                How to Peel Peaches, 3 Ways\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                27 Healthy Lunches for Kids\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            View All Recipes\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Pages\n\n\n\n                            Low & Slow Oven Baked Ribs - Super Simple!\n                        \n                            21 Top-Notch Halibut Recipes\n                        \n                            Jo Mama's World Famous Spaghetti\n                        \n                            Simple Oven-Baked Sea Bass\n                        \n                            Broil a Perfect Steak\n                        \n                            35 Best Pork Chop Recipes\n                        \n                            43 Favorite Potluck Recipes\n                        \n                            42 Rise-and-Shine Breakfast Casseroles\n                        \n                            Perfect Rump Roast\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind More Recipes\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\n\n\nicons / social / facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nicons / social / pinterest\n\n\nicons / social / twitter\n\n\nicons / social / youtube\n\n\nicons / email\n\n\n\n\n\n                            All Categories\n                        \n                            Site Map\n                        \n                            About Us\n                        \n                            Help\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    The Discovery Family of Networks\n                    \n\n\nHGTV\n\n\nDIY Network\n\n\nFood Network\n\n\nCooking Channel\n\n\nTravel Channel\n\n\nHGTV Poland\n\n\n\n\n                    \u00a9 2023 Warner Bros.
