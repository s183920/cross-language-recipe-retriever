Add the farfalle and cook for 11 minutes (nearly al dente). Drain.Steam the broccoli just until tender. Drain and chop into florets. Toss with the cooked pasta.Coarsely chop two of the tomatoes and add them to the pasta.Stir in the chopped onion and minced garlic, along with the drained chickpeas, and 1/2 cup of the chopped basil.Tear 2/3 of the fresh mozzarella into marble-sized chunks and fold into the pasta mixture.Whisk the eggs with the cottage cheese and lemon juice. Stir in 1/2 cup of Parmesan. Stir this liquid into the pasta mixture with salt and pepper until well combined.Spread the pasta in the prepared baking dish.Slice the remaining tomato into half-moons and arrange on top of the pasta. Tear the rest of the mozzarella into bits and scatter between the tomato slices.Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese on top, and drizzle with olive oil.Bake for 35 minutes or until the cheese on top has melted and the casserole is bubbling. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with the remaining chopped basil. Let stand for a few more minutes before serving.\n\n\n\n\n\nicons / social / pinterest\n\n\nicons / email\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions & Replies\n\n\n\n\n\n Sign In  to Ask a Question \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Got a question?\n      \n\n        Share it with the community!\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nWrite A Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Have any thoughts about this recipe?\n      \n\n        Share it with the community!\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nTweaks\n\n\nMOST POPULARMOST RECENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I suffer from reflux so I made some changes. I reduced the onions to 9 oz. (all I had on hand) and tomatoes to 2. I also added a can of drained artichoke hearts to add more flavor that I might have lost from reducing the onions and tomatoes. I reduced the mozzarella to about 6 oz., again to help my digestion, and left out one of the egg yolks. It was still fantastic!
